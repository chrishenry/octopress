title: Blackberry OS will never take over the world

A few days ago, I installed [Opera Mini](http://www.opera.com/mini/) on my
Blackberry Curve. The experience offered by Opera Mini is really impressive.
It retrieves and renders pages quickly and flawlessly. The interface is
specifically designed to handle navigating long pages on a tiny screen. In
short, it's a great app, and a major improvement on the Blackberry Browser.

  
Here's the catch (or catches). Links that appear in other applications won't
open in Opera, they'll open in the Blackberry browser. What's worse is that
Opera's location bar does not have an option to paste links directly into the
location bar. In order to paste a link into the location bar, you need to hit
the symbol key, which brings up an edit screen pre-populated with 'www.' You
need to erase the www, and _then_ you can paste your link in.

  
That lengthy process completely kills any satisfaction you may get out of
having a workable browser on a Blackberry. And none of it is Opera's fault. On
most other OSes, clicking URLs in any application will fire up the default
browser and retrieve the URL. Hell, on iPhone OS, you can set up protocol
handlers that will open up other apps. Hopefully RIM will provide a means for
applications to talk to each other soon. Creating the seamless interaction
between apps is probably even more important than pushing App World.
