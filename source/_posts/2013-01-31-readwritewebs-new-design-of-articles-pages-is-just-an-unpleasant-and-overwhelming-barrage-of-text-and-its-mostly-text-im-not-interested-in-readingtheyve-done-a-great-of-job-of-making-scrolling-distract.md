ReadWriteWeb’s new design of articles pages is just an unpleasant and overwhelming
barrage of text. And it’s mostly text I’m not interested in reading.

They’ve done a great of job of making scrolling distracting, by ensuring that all
the content that you don’t want to see (related links, blogroll) does something
you don’t expect.
