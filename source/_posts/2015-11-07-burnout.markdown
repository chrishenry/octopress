It was 4:43 PM. As I headed out the door, someone asked, "Leaving early?". No
malice, no judgment, just a bit of surprise. The office was still full,
keyboards clicking and the drone of technical conversation dully throbbing. "I'm
entitled to it, I just worked for 3 days straight on an incident," I shot back.

Was I entitled to bail early? Probably, but that wasn't the right way to phrase
it. I needed it to leave. To be away from the firehose of alerts, problems, lack
of solutions, apathy and anxiety. The incident in question was a days long spam
attack on my company's site. It wasn't my first rodeo with hackers, but this
time the mitigation required bringing several groups together, and a pronounced
lack of resources from my own team. This attack came at a time when we were
gearing up to launch a new product, and I had been intensely involved with
ensuring the stability of a new, shaky platform.

I took the next two days off, calling in sick. I had already spoken with my
manager, told him I was tired. He kindly ordered me to go home, and take a
vacation. This was the second time in a month I'd unexpectedly needed time off.
At home, I crashed, played video games, watched a bunch of movies my
girlfriend normally wouldn't palate, and generally just tried to avoid the real
world. Physically, I wasn't all that tired, considering I had only slept 9 hours
over the past 3 days. But my mind and my nerves were totally shot.

In short, I burned out. Hard.

Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion caused by
excessive and prolonged stress. It manifests itself in ways including anxiety,
loss of motivation and confidence, and even degradation of physical health.
Burnout can be prevalent in organizations that promote hero culture and where
employees maintain a strong a sense of duty...

I lead operations at a small part of a large company, and I've been there a very
long time. My mission has been to ensure the company's online presence is up and
safe. Admittedly, my sense of duty to that mission has always been somewhat
overzealous. In fact, much of my identity is tied up in the job I do. Once I got
bored with the Xbox, I went through a journal I've been keeping for a few years.

In it, there were multiple notes and rants pointing to the simple fact that I
have an unhealthy work-life balance. I found a long running list of songs to
learn on guitar, but I haven't picked up my guitar in several months. I have
notes on code projects I started but didn't make any progress on for years.
There are links to museum exhibits I wanted to visit that closed long ago.
Reading through, I also realized I don't have any more than a handful of friends
outside of work. All in all, it was a lot of regret.

But also a lot of reasons to make some changes. I realize I don't need a
vacation, I need a change in how I manage my energy. I need to be more
cognizant of my own mental health, and back away at the slightest sign of
nearing the burnout zone. Presented without comment, my signs of burnout;

 - Saying "No" to everything, even the reasonable things
 - No forward momentum
 - Inability to express myself
 - Shortness with team members during normal interactions
 - Constant [amygdala hijack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack)
 - Inability to stay on task, or read anything longer than an email
 - Many nights in a row falling asleep while attempting to watch John Oliver

Things I need to do to prevent getting to this place in the future;

 - Tightly limit my hours
 - Let go of certain things that don't need to be done
 - Be OK with things not happening, and the failures that result
 - Commit to the things I want to do; cooking, fun projects, social events
 - Don't accept any new work

The other hard reality is that for me to affect this change, I will need to let
go of a lot of that sense of duty that has led me to burnout. There are going to
be some failures, but we all need to be OK with that.

Wish me luck.
