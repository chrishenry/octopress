It was 443. As I headed out the door, someone asked, "Leaving early?". No
malice, no judgment, just a bit of surprise. The office was still full,
keyboards clicking and the drone of technical conversation dully throbbing. "Iâ€™m
entitled to it, I just worked for 3 days straight on an incident," I shot back.

Was I entitled to bail early? Probably, but that probably wasn't the right way
to phrase it. I needed it, and without getting away from the firehose of alerts,
problems, and anxiety, I would probably implode. Or worse, explode. Not that I
hadn't already. The incident in question was a days long spam attack on my
company's site. It wasn't my first rodeo with hackers, but this time the
mitigation required bringing several groups together, and a pronounced lack
of resources from my own team.

I took the next two days off, calling in sick. I had already spoken with my
manager, told him I was tired. He kindly ordered me to go home, and take a
vacation. This was the second time in a month I'd taken Thursday and Friday off.
At home, I crashed, I played video games, watched a bunch of movies my
girlfriend normally wouldn't palate, and generally just tried to avoid the real
world. Physically, I wasn't all that tired, considering I had only slept 9 hours
over the past 3 days. But my nerves, and my mind were totally shot.

In short, I burned out. Hard.

I lead operations at a small part of a large company, and I've been there a very
long time. My mission has been to ensure the company's online presence is up and
safe. It has been for a long time, and my sense of duty to that mission has
always been somewhat unhealthy. Once I got bored with the Xbox, I went
through a journal I've been keeping for a few years. In it, there
were multiple notes and rants pointing to the simple fact that I have an
unhealthy lifestyle. Lists of songs to learn on guitar that I've never learned.
Code projects started and discarded. Museums, exhibits and day trips to go,
all never done. A long list of family events I skipped out on for the wrong
reasons.
