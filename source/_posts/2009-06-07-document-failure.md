When things go wrong, there is always a reason. Sometimes it's a good one. (I
had no idea $_SERVER wasn't available from the CLI) Sometimes it's a really
bad one. (I left 2 seconds after running the build script, and I didn't test
beforehand.) Whatever the reason is, the question needs to be asked 'How can
we never, ever let this happen again?' Once we arrive at a good answer to that
question, it's really important that you hold that answer in a vise-like grip,
and never let it go. Because knowing how to prevent problems, and actually
taking the steps to prevent them are two very different things.

  
That is why I keep a Book of Fail. I will write down the consequences and
circumstances of a particular catastrophe as a permanent record. I make sure
to physically write it down because the act of writing with a pencil, unlike
typing, requires significant effort, and helps to deeply ingrain what I have
chosen to record. Secondly, keeping these records in a physical journal means
that however many crappy Macs I burn through, or hosting plans I forget to pay
for, I will still be able to carry my Moleskine around.

  
Periodically reading through the Book is also crucial to keeping these painful
moments fresh. Many people will claim to have learned from a mistake, but will
continually repeat the same doomed process over and over without a second's
thought. Once having a made a mistake a couple times, it should never be
repeated.
