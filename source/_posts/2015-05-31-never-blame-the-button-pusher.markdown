While out with someone, the topic of improving execution within an organization
came up. There had been several high profile incidents, and a lot of low profile
incidents. For background, this org has not had a lot of operations experience,
and hasn't quite cut their teeth on understanding what a risky procedure is.

Many of the failures in question could have been avoided by having a
conscientious operator. At one point in the conversation, the following was
said;

> The people who push the buttons that cause problems should be fired. Heads
> should roll.

I was a bit taken aback. In my short career, I've pushed a lot of buttons
that have caused __a lot__ of problems. And what was said was certainly not a
suggestion I should be canned. The frustration that led to the statement was
that most postmortems turned up human error as the root cause of most incidents.
Of course, that was when a root cause was reached at all.

There are 2 major problems with the sentiments described. The first is that the
person pushing the button may be just following a run book or SOP.

Assigning
blame to a person for following what is supposed to be a well designed set of
actions to remediate a system is bad juju.

Assigning blame to a person for these problems creates fear and distrust in an
organization. So much so that operators will fear to do the right thing, or to
even think for themselves.

The second is that

In which
case, that person is not in the wrong in what they did. Of course, any person
following instructions is still in control of their destiny, and should
__always__ exercise judgment in anything they are asked to do.

As I've focused on continually improving systems, I've found that the design of
the system and the ability of a team of to think through what to do are the
things that actually make a difference.
