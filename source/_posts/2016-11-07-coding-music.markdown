This Fall, I've found myself in an 8-bit, video game mood. With some bluegrass,
for good measure.

### _Bastion & Transistor Soundtrack_, Darren Korb

[Bastion](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/) and [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/) are
gorgeous, ethereal iOS games put out by the venerable studio [Supergiant](https://www.supergiantgames.com/).
This [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/12120784036/playlist/6adQEWCx8PXWVVmemdim7t)
does a great job of gathering the two soundtracks and adding a couple remixes,
for fun. While video game soundtracks should be pretty obvious background
music for coding (especially the final boss themes), I've never found one that
was as sensitive, narrative and well thought out as this. In particular, Ashley
Barret's hummed tracks are wonderful for feeling the melody while not having to
get all tangled in words.

### _Hacker's Coffee_, Spotify Playlist

### _Radio_, Steep Canyon Rangers

I randomly saw Steve Martin with the Steep Canyon Rangers recently. While I've
never been a fan of bluegrass, I was super impressed by what I heard and felt.
Turns out the busyness of the bango (which should be quite distracting),
actually turns into a lovely melange.
