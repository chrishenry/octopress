This Fall, I've found myself in an 8-bit, video game mood. With some bluegrass,
for good measure.

### _Bastion & Transistor Soundtrack_, Darren Korb

[Bastion](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/) and [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/) are
gorgeous, ethereal iOS games put out by the venerable studio [Supergiant](https://www.supergiantgames.com/).
This [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/12120784036/playlist/6adQEWCx8PXWVVmemdim7t)
does a great job of gathering the two soundtracks and adding a couple remixes,
for fun. While video game soundtracks should be pretty obvious background
music for coding (especially the final boss themes), I've never found one that
was as sensitive, narrative and well thought out as this. In particular, Ashley
Barret's hummed tracks are wonderful for feeling the melody while not having to
get all tangled in words.

### _Hacker's Coffee_, Spotify Playlist

I was looking for a good coding soundtrack, and turned to Spotify's search for
some quick wins. There were a ton of great lists, but [Hacker's Coffee](https://open.spotify.com/user/omegak/playlist/4mWcjE2mVcaALYi6v8hDZN)
was the only one that not only held me, but sent me looking looking for music
from the featured artists. Highlights include Hans Zimmer's _Mombassa_,  from the
Inception Soundtrack, a number of tracks by 65 days of static, and Infiltration,
from the Mass Effect Soundtrack. Due to this soundtrack's sheer depth (532
tracks), there is a high chance you're going to find something you like.

### _Radio_, Steep Canyon Rangers

I randomly saw Steve Martin with the Steep Canyon Rangers recently. While I've
never been a fan of bluegrass, I was super impressed by what I heard and felt.
Turns out the twangy busyness of the banjo (which should be quite distracting),
actually turns into a lovely m√©lange when backed by guitars and mandolin. Look
out for all the awesome fiddle hooks, too, especially on the title track
_Radio_.
