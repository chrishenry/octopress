title: The Technician, now on a Cloud Server
categories: 
---
I am pleased to announce that this site is now hosted on the [Rackspace
Cloud](http://bit.ly/4LrOTd). It was a simple migration from MediaTemple, and
has given me the level of control I want. I got to choose my OS (CentOS),
versions of php and MySQL, and setup apache how I like it. I'm free of Plesk
and those and the limitations therein.

  
The one thing I would really like to see from the Rackspace Cloud is DNS
Support. My goal when migrating
[[http://chr.ishenry.com](http://chr.ishenry.com)](http://chr.ishenry.com) was
to move entirely off of MediaTemple. The one thing I really did like about
hosting with them was that DNS was integrated directly into the service. With
the Rackspace Cloud, there was no such convenience. However, a quick signup
with [DynDNS](http://bit.ly/8AYkxJ) and a tweak to my domain registrar solved
that.

  
Big thanks to Ryan Kearney's [video tutorial](http://bit.ly/8YZtH3) for the
yum command that brought everything together.
