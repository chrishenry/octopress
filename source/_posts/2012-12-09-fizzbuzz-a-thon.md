The [FizzBuzz](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-
program.html) test is a simple way of showing that a developer has mastery of
basic concepts like loops, variables and operators. Having given the test to
other developers several times, I felt like a bit of hypocrite having never
actually having taken it myself. I've also asked folks to complete the task in
php, even though it wasn't a language they were particularly familiar with.
So, I decided it was time to end the hypocrisy, and give myself a little
challenge:

  
**Do FizzBuzz in as many languages as I could.**  
  
So, what did I learn?

  * With the [internet](http://chr.ishenry.com/2011/06/13/development-without-internet-access/), you can learn the basics of most programming languages in about 5 minutes.
  * Programming knowledge is portable between most common web languages. A loop is a loop, a variable is a variable, etc. Syntax for a task this simple can be learned in a few minutes.
  * FizzBuzz *can* be done in sql, bitch.
  * Clojure is hard for no reason.
  * Lisp is basically impossible to get running.
  * Languages have uptake because they're included with the OS and have good documentation and communities.
In the end, doing FizzBuzz in 10 languages took around 5 hours. There was,
however, significant time taken for screwing around on Twitter, potty breaks,
drinking too much coffee, [curmedgeon-ing on
StackOverflow,](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13536889/php-works-but-
gives-sql-syntax-error/13536929#comment18536820_13536929) drinking beer, and
making carnitas. Time was also spent looking for a way to run my FizzBuzzes in
bash and benchmark them, which proved fruitless, since OS X doesn't support
nanoseconds in the date command.
