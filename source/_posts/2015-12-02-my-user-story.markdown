Alternate titles;
How I learned to understand my worries and why I love my friends
Passion drives business, and why it's OK to make it personal

Key ideas;
 - the people i've known have driven me
 - - They don't know it.
 - - 
 - making business personal is a driver of success
 - - note the other edge of the above sword.

During the course of life, everyone finds their reasons for getting up in the
morning, for working, and for being passionate. You can find inspiration to get
up and kick ass from anywhere; cats, wanting money, wanting fame, wanting sex.
But more likely than not, you wake up and think about a person that matters to
you and do what they need to make their life great.

That person can really be anyone. A friend, spouse, partner, lover, coffee cart
proprietor. But there's definitely someone you think of when you do your work
that inspires and drives you to dig and fight. It could be soeone close to you,
or it could even be someone in your past who made a difference for you, so
making a difference for them seems...criticaol.

For me, that person is J. We met a long time ago, when I had no idea what I
wanted to do, or who I wanted to be. He was kind to me, and guided me through a
couple of years where I was rudderless. As it turned out, years later, he wound
up being the key demographic of the business I helped to build. 

Working in operations can sometimes mean being a long way from your customer.
You have servers, developers, UIs and marketing in between you and the people
that actually mean something to you business. So when you chown everything to
root, you're sure as shit not thinking about the consequences to your users.

Negative consequences from real people when you fuck up is something ops teams
don't have to face too often. Postmortems happens, someone may slap you on the
wrist, or trust you less, but that's probably it. No one you know lost life,
limb or reputation. So no worries, right?

But what if someone you know and respect got hurt? Maybe they lost a business
opportunity. Maybe they got fucked by a competitor. Maybe they're down on their
luck and your product was supposed to make a difference.

This all smacks of making business personal. And of course, when things are just
business, you should never take them personally. But whhat if people close to
you do? What if people you love, but haven't spoken to in a long time get hurt.
Business isn't supposed to be personal, but what happens when it appears
that way?

IMO, bringing the personal into your business can be the factor that makes or
breaks the business. I want to be driven in the work I do, and money alone won't
ever do that. 

We all want to be passionate about (feel passion for) the work we do, but
finding REAL drivers is difficult. Money is not a driver of passion.  Nor is
ambition. 

Generalization of a group can help, but groups are big an impersonal.   


pas·sion
ˈpaSHən/Submit
noun
1.
strong and barely controllable emotion.

Takeaways;
 - Always work hard, as if someone else's life or job depends upon it.
 - Bring the personal passion in, dont let it show, or let in the way of being
 professional.
