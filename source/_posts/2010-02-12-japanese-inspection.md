Everybody procrastinates. Some tasks that get pushed off don't matter, it just
gets done later. Some tasks that go over deadline result in profanities and
bloody noses. But every once in a while, tasks come along that have an
expiration date. As in, if it doesn't get done by a certain time, it doesn't
matter.

  

> You ever heard of a "Japanese Inspection?" Japanese Inspection, you see,
when the Japs take in a load of lettuce they're not sure they wanna let in the
country, why they'll just let it sit there on the dock 'til they get good and
ready to look at, But then of course, it's all gone rotten… ain't nothing left
to inspect. You see, lettuce is a perishable item…like you two monkeys.

What Big John was referring to was the fact that all he had to do was ignore
Cole and Rowdy until they didn't any fight left in them. Tasks can be just the
same way. Eventually, the need for the task to be done just goes away, or
starts to smell. The only thing that really matters is being able to tell the
difference between the things that **really** need to get done, and the things
that just aren't important enough to get done.
