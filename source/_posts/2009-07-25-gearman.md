Users have high expectations of web apps in terms of performance,
responsiveness and tons of features. Normally, you're only allowed two of any
list of three really cool things. In the case of Web Apps, that would be true.
Most will find some compromise of between performance / responsiveness and
tons of features. More features usually equals less responsiveness, depending
on the feature and scale.

  
Enter Gearman. [Gearman](http://bit.ly/1Wrot) is a queuing system that allows
work to be farmed out to other servers. Most importantly, it allows for
intense tasks to be queued and performed in the background. This means that
when a user performs an action that could potentially take a long time
(sending notification emails, updating Full Text indexes, etc), that slow task
can be queued to run in the background, and the page can be sent to the user,
keeping things snappy.

  
Gearman is pretty simple to install on Red Hat.

  
download gearman from server> wget [http://launchpad.net/gearmand/trunk/0.8/+d
ownload/gearmand-0.8.tar.gz](http://launchpad.net/gearmand/trunk/0.8/+download
/gearmand-0.8.tar.gz)

  
unzip and move into the directory> tar -xvzf gearmand-0.8.tar.gz> cd
gearmand-0.8

  
Red Hat didn't have some dependencies. The next few steps will vary depending
on your *nix distro.

  
Install the libevent developer library.> yum install libevent-devel

  
Install the e2fsprogs developer library> yum install e2fsprogs-devel

  
configure and install> ./configure> make> make install

  
/** Net Gearman **/

  
download php extension from the pecl repo> wget [http://pecl.php.net/get/gearm
an-0.4.0.tgz](http://pecl.php.net/get/gearman-0.4.0.tgz)

  
untar> tar -xvf gearman-0.4.0.tgz

  
build the extension> phpize> ./configure> make> make test> make install

  
Add the extension to the php.ini

  
[gearman]extension=gearman.so

  
And you're all set!

  
Integration will depend on if you decide to use the php extension, and how
encapsulated the code base is. I highly recommend using the pecl extension, as
it provides great implementations of the client and worker. [ and Gearman will
save you.](http://bit.ly/TunGR)
