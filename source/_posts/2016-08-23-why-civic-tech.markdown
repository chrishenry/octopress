In a lot of ways, tech has failed the nation.

538's fiery crash of a [prediction engine](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=2016-election)
led many people astray. The idea that we could boil down the emotional wants of
our nation to a simple probability was fatally flawed.

Facebook has done more to divide the nation than connect us. Groups of friends
have turned into opinion-impermeable bubbles, with no chance of civil
discourse, and no trust of the "other side".

One measure of a country is ease of access to information. We have access to
more information than ever before, but lack the ability to make any sense of it.
Or worse, are unwilling to trust it.

As a American, this is a troubling time. As a technologist, this is a nightmare,
to see trust in online tools eroding before our eyes.

Let's just review why we're here in tech, specifically civic tech, to begin with.
[Information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free),
and everything we build should be in the interest of making information more
accessible. Facts are important, as is presenting them simply and beautifully.
The mere presence of public information is the very start of accountability
amongst peers and government. Applying the latest tools to solve long-existing
problems is the stuff that the nation is built on.

A rallying cry to technologists has been to go out and build. While the
sentiment is amazing, I must caution that energy needs to be directed towards
existing, meaningful projects that are resource starved, and not creating
something new. There are plenty of struggling efforts that need help. Don't
create a new one. Even when looking to contribute, there is a high opportunity
cost of working on the wrong project, so choose carefully.

Here's some projects and organizations you should be working with;
 * The [National Voter File](http://www.nationalvoterfile.org/), for enabling
 access to all states' voter registries. This is critical, as the ability to
 understand the constituency easily does not exist today.
 * The [Congress API](https://github.com/propublica/congress), currently run by
 the venerable Propublica. The Congress API is one of the best sources of data
 on Congress, bills and legislators. Propublica has bravely taken on the task
 of running the Congress API.
* [The Progressive Coders Network](http://www.progcode.co/) is a group of
techies who originated in the Bernie Sanders camp, and have continued to build
open source tools to further the progressive movement.
