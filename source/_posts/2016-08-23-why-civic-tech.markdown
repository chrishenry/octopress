What I’m About
 - Tech for moving organizations forward
 - The really nitty gritty gooey bits.
 - - DNS, servers, security,
 - Making sure processes within an organization match the goals
 - The immune system of a organization
 - - rejecting ideas that have no merit

What tech is about
 - empowering people
 - enabling organizations
 - codifying process

Data wants to be free
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free
 - - free in price OR free as in freedom
 - Facts are important, as is presenting them simply and beautifully
 - the problem with existing data is that it’s either inaccessible or unapproachable

Accountability
 - Clearly present the differences (wrong word, looking for diff, but in laymans’ terms) in constituent desires and congressional action

Moved to IssueVoter
Hello World, I’m looking for a job. I have a bunch of experience moving data through systems, working with designers, fighting hackers, defending form hackers, connecting people to the cause/mission, and feeling my way through problems not felt before.

Since $job-1 I’ve been in search of a problem that once solved, could lead to a large number of people being better informed, better connected, and happier as a result.

I’m not fucking interested in putting motherfucking mustaches on crappy cats or shitty selfies.

I joined issuevoter because i despise the lack of accountability in government. The data is out there for people to see if their congresspeople are voting the way constituents want them to. However, it’s hidden in a quagmire of legalese, jargon, and outdated design.

I met Maria, and she explained what she was doing. Upon hearing the mission, I realized I had no idea who my dipshit congressperson was. Then I was fairly pissed off at myself for not knowing any of that.

Then I took cursory look at trying to find the kind of information that would lead to accountability. Congressional votes, attendance (these guys don't even fucking show up sometimes), yea or nay, serving on committees. The data is actually out there. But it took me, someone considers Google more important that certain nerve endings, quite a bit of time and pain to actually find what I was looking for.

Then I actually looked at the laws that were moving through our (congressional, legal, lawmaking) system. Most of them were titled incomprehensibly. Some were outright not important. Some were incredibly touchy/sensitive but titled something mundane. None of them were

For the average person to find all the information to determine if their congress person agrees with them, it would take days or weeks.
OR
The information is so raw and unapproachable that it would take people days or weeks to evaluate a Congresspersons agreement over their term.

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
THIS IS FUCKED
Clearly, this won’t do.
This is seriously problematic.
This can be better
This can be fixed
Why has no one fixed this?
Why do I hate all the things?
w.t.f.

However, happily, thankfully, saving throw, the information is out there. Our government has begrudgingly made Congressional records available online. Wonderful organizations like Sunlight Labs and CTCL (Center for Technology and Community something or other) have done a wonderful job of making the michmash of nonstandardized, random, piecemeal data out there consumable. Which means that the time is ripe for that data to be thoughtfully presented, broadcast, mashed up to people. Once mashed up with actual public opinion, people will begin to see whether the congresspeople who are closest to them / serving them are
actually doing just that.

Politicians' jobs are to represent those that have deemed them worthy / elected them / etc. As with any / all of us, we're all beholden to those that write our paychecks / give us power. With any job, performance must be measured and feedback must be exchanged.
