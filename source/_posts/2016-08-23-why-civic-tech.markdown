In a lot of ways, tech has failed the nation.

Nate Silver's fiery crash of a prediction engine led many people astray. The thought that we could boil down
the state of mind of the nation to a simple probability was fatally egotistical.

Facebook has done more to divide the nation than connect us. Groups of friends
have turned into impermeable bubbles with no information exchange, and certainly
no chance of civil discourse.

One measure of a country is ease of access to information. We have access to
more information than ever before, but lack the ability to make any sense of it.

Let's just review why we're here in tech to begin with. [Information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free),
and everything we build should be in the interest of making information more
accessible. Facts are important, as is presenting them simply and beautifully.
The mere presence of public information is the very start of accountability
amongst peers and government.

Finding and vetting information, enabling fact checkers and responsible
editorial processes is will in the purview of tech. Everything we build should
empower or enable the public. They should come to your site, app, tool, whatever
and be able to do something they couldn't do before, or do it way more easily
than they did before.

A rallying cry to technologists the past 2 weeks has been to go out and build.
While the sentiment is amazing, I must caution that energy needs to be directed
towards existing projects that are struggling, and not creating something new.
There are plenty of struggling efforts that need help. Don't create a new one.

Here's some projects you should be working with;
 * The [National Voter File](http://www.nationalvoterfile.org/), for enabling
 access to all states' voter registries. This is critical, as the ability to
 understand the constituency easily does not exist today.
 * The [Congress API](https://github.com/propublica/congress), currently run by
 the venerable Propublica. The Congress API is one of the best sources of data
 on Congress, bills and legislators. Probpublica has bravely taken on the task
 of running the Congress API.





Politicians' jobs are to represent those that have deemed them worthy / elected them / etc. As with any / all of us, we're all beholden to those that write our paychecks / give us power. With any job, performance must be measured and feedback must be exchanged.
