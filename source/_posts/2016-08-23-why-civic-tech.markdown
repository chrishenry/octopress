In a lot of ways, tech has failed the nation.

Nate Silver's fiery crash of a prediction engine led many people astray. The thought that we could boil down
the state of mind of the nation to a simple probability was fatally egotistical.

One measure of a country is ease of access to information.

On rallying cry to technologists the past 2 weeks has been to go out and build. While the sentiment is amazing, I must caution that energy needs to be directed towards existing projects that are struggling, and not creating something new. There are plenty of struggling efforts that need help. Don't create a new one.

Here's some projects you should be working with;
 * The National Voter File, for enabling access to all states voter registries.

What I’m About
 - Tech for moving organizations forward
 - The really nitty gritty gooey bits.
 - - DNS, servers, security,
 - Making sure processes within an organization match the goals
 - The immune system of a organization
 - - rejecting ideas that have no merit

What tech is about
 - empowering people
 - enabling organizations
 - codifying processes

Data wants to be free
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free
 - - free in price OR free as in freedom
 - Facts are important, as is presenting them simply and beautifully
 - the problem with existing data is that it’s either inaccessible or unapproachable

Accountability
 - Clearly present the differences (wrong word, looking for diff, but in laymans’ terms) in constituent desires and congressional action

Since $job-1 I’ve been in search of a problem that once solved, could lead to a large number of people being better informed, better connected, and happier as a result.

Then I took cursory look at trying to find the kind of information that would lead to accountability. Congressional votes, attendance (these guys don't even fucking show up sometimes), yea or nay, serving on committees. The data is actually out there. But it took me, someone considers Google more important that certain nerve endings, quite a bit of time and pain to actually find what I was looking for.

Then I actually looked at the laws that were moving through our (congressional, legal, lawmaking) system. Most of them were titled incomprehensibly. Some were outright not important. Some were incredibly touchy/sensitive but titled something mundane. None of them were

For the average person to find all the information to determine if their congress person agrees with them, it would take days or weeks.
OR
The information is so raw and unapproachable that it would take people days or weeks to evaluate a Congresspersons agreement over their term.

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
THIS IS FUCKED
Clearly, this won’t do.
This is seriously problematic.
This can be better
This can be fixed
Why has no one fixed this?
Why do I hate all the things?
w.t.f.

However, happily, thankfully, saving throw, the information is out there. Our government has begrudgingly made Congressional records available online. Wonderful organizations like Sunlight Labs and CTCL (Center for Technology and Community something or other) have done a wonderful job of making the michmash of nonstandardized, random, piecemeal data out there consumable. Which means that the time is ripe for that data to be thoughtfully presented, broadcast, mashed up to people. Once mashed up with actual public opinion, people will begin to see whether the congresspeople who are closest to them / serving them are
actually doing just that.

Politicians' jobs are to represent those that have deemed them worthy / elected them / etc. As with any / all of us, we're all beholden to those that write our paychecks / give us power. With any job, performance must be measured and feedback must be exchanged.
