Hiring in tech is oft talked and written about topic, but most of the content
out there tends to focus on technical skills, interview questions, and
whiteboarding. While finding a technical fit is at the core of the task, it's
often a cold process that ignores the value of finding a candidate who can join
a team and contribute more than just code.

A while ago, I listened to a [Special Sauce](http://www.seriouseats.com/tags/special%20sauce%20podcast)
podcast interviewing Danny Meyer. Danny Meyer is the CEO of Union Square
Hospitality Group, the organization behind Union Square Cafe, Shake Shack, and a
slew of other notable restaurants. He believes there are six emotional
qualities that are critical to a team member's success. Here they are, and
how they relate to being a successful tech hire.

Optimistic kindness.

Team members need to be hopeful. Nothing shuts down a team quicker than someone
who is pessimistic about new ideas and creativity. There are tons of code
problems that are solvable, and treating them as such helps create a team
committed to moving forward. Enthusiasm during ideation helps drive energy and
execution.

Curious intelligence.

Every day is an opportunity to learn something new. In tech, things change
ridiculously quickly. Without curiosity, team members' skills stagnate.
Without openly exploring how things can be improved, product languishes.
Treating new features as an experiment is critical to discovering what works,
and being deeply curious about interactions will help build domain knowledge
for the team.

Work ethic.

You can't train someone to care deeply about doing the work right. Many don't
realize that the success of their own work translates to success for the entire
team.

Empathy.

Be aware of the wake you're leaving, and care about what it does to others.
Everything we say and do has consequences. Ignoring asks for help, or failing to
document and discuss the work you do makes it more difficult for those you with
to build on what you've done.

Self awareness.

Understanding what your personal weather report is, and how it affects others.
Knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and acting accordingly is what allows you
to be a truly productive team member.

Integrity.

Have the judgment to do the right thing, even if not in your own self interest.
