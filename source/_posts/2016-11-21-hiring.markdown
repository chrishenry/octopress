No one can be trained to be motivated to make you feel good. 6 emotional skills that are required to be on a great hospitality team.

Optimistic kindness; they need to be hopeful.
Curious intelligence; every day is an opportunity to learn something new
Work ethic; you can't train someone to care about doing the work right.
Empathy; be aware of the wake you're leaving, and care what it does to other boats.
Self awareness; understanding what your personal weather report is, and how it affects others.
Integrity; have the judgment to do the right thing, even if not in your own self interest.
