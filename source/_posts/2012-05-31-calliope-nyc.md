On the corner of East 4th Street, the newest of the New American restaurants,
[Calliope](http://calliopenyc.com/) has soft launched. It's in a beautiful
space in a great part of the East Village. The dining room is open and airy,
thanks to being on the corner, and there being windows 2 of 4 sides of the
room. At one of the space is a georgous curved blonde wood bar. There is more
comfortable than usual outdoor seating.

  
Even before launch. they have already aquired a liquor license, but do not
have a cocktail list. The bar is suprisingly well stocked with a number of
classic European tipples; Pimms and campari were featured. The old-fashioned
left a bit to be desired, but the bartender made a decent manhattan.

  
The food was mostly well-executed. I had a slow cooked rabbit Pappardelle with
Fava beans.  It seems like they're still tweaking the menu, as the dish was
listed as having peas in place of the Fava beans. The roast chicken with
carrots and cabbage was also stellar. The skin was crispy, well seasoned, the
carrots were the perfect texture, and the chicken stuffed cabbage lent some
color.

  
Once the staff settles in, and the menu is finalized, Calliope is going to be
a great addition to and already incredible neighborhood.
