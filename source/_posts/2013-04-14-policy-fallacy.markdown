> "The Navy is a master plan designed by geniuses for execution by idiots. If you're not an idiot, but find yourself in the Navy, you can only operate well by pretending to be one."
> -Herman Wouk, The Caine Mutiny

The worst arguments I've ever had were with people who weren't willing to bend on a particular rule or policy. The contention arose from the fact that they couldn't see where the edicts of a policy would completely fail.

ironclad policy for a situation that needed to be treated differently. Had I pretended to be an idiot and follow the rules, I would've been just fine.

However, startups aren't the navy, and there's no place for a master plan, only a loose framework cobbled together from an awareness of the recent situation at hand.

policy is idiots making rules for idiots

process is smart people trying to structure communication.

Only The most intelligent can move between them. Or just tell the difference.


Policy will always fail where judgement will succeed.

Judgement will always succeed where policy will fail.
