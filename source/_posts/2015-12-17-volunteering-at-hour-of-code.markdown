Yesterday, as part of the Hour of Code, I went to [Information Technology High
School](http://ithsnyc.org/2013/home) in Long Island City. I spent the morning
talking to students there about what it's like to work in web operations.

It was amazing to see students taking an interest in technology and coding. Many
of them had already completed the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us)
projects given to them last week. Others were tinkering with the projects still,
seeing what they could add. I spent some time critiquing and reviewing work they
done in Mrs. Ramirez's Web Design class. The students had all created functional
portfolio sites, complete with content, small bits of javascript, and even Flash
games.

The students were interested in my day to day, and the path I took to get
there. The students were amazed to hear that I didn't work in a dark closet by
myself, but in a brightly lit office constantly interacting with colleagues.
They were also amazed to hear that the skills they needed to be truly successful
in tech weren't just coding and hardware, but communication, teamwork, and
judgment.

Students were particularly interested to hear about about some of the
work I've done around security and incident response. Tales of defending
against DDoS and spam attacks were a great way to let them know that career
paths in tech aren't just limited to coding or back office IT. In fact, I truly
hope that some students are inspired to pursue a career in Systems
Administration and Web Operations.

One thing that was made clear to me as I was asked to describe my path to Web
Operations was there is no clear path, and that sad fact has resulted in a
shortage of people in the field. I would encourage other folks in Web Operations
to spend some time talking to young students about the work that we do in the
hopes that in a few years the industry will grow and mature. After all, for
every few students that learn to code, there need to be a few students who know
how to run the servers that run that code.
