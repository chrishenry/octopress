The past year has been an extremely busy one. There have been a number of challenges placed in front of me that were somewhat all-consuming. While there's been plenty of introspection, much of it has been exceedingly private. My goal for the end of the year is to consider what I've learned in the past 9 or so months, and share it publicly. Wish me luck.
