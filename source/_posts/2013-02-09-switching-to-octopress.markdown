Wordpress was old and busted, tumblr wouldn't even let me embed an iframe, it was time to switch, get some more control, and make a project out of it.

I do miss my old Wordpress blog, but it was definitely time to change, as that had been my blog layout for years. It was mostly an experiment for me to set up a Rackspace cloud server. 

Much the same, setting up Octopress has been an experiment in looking at another language (ruby, and some python), getting more familiar with git, and getting even more acquainted with SublimeText.
