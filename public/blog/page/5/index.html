			Out of the Terminal</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every once and a while I get to leave server-land and get to do some fun
projects that involve doing something on the front end. The latest was
building an embed script for the Behance <a href="http://www.behance.net/joblist">Job
List</a>. Projects like this, that get me out of
the terminal and into a space that requires a bit more interaction between
domains, are particularly appealing. As much as I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same Origin
Policy</a> is reasonable rule
for security, I love looking at ways to get around it.</p>

<p>The technique I chose for this was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#JSONP">JSONP</a>, or JSON with Padding. I&#8217;m a
huge fan of JSON as a transport, as I feel it is compact, flexible and
stupidly simple to generate and consume. In fact, I&#8217;ve sworn to never touch
another XML file as long as I live. JSONP is really convenient from a API
implementation perspective, because when the request for the data is made (via
the script tag), all the client has to do is pass a callback and it can use
the data in any way it chooses. The server doesn&#8217;t have to be aware of what
the callback actually does, although I do recommend checking against a list of
pre-approved callbacks, just to make sure.</p>

<p>Like any semi-decent developer, I have dog-fooded my own work, and implemented
the Behance Joblist embed code right <a href="/design-jobs/">here.</a></p>

<p>A little about the Behance Joblist:</p>

<blockquote><p>Top global companies find and hire talent on Behance, the world&#8217;s leading
network for creative professionals.</p></blockquote>

			Accountability Is a Feedback Loop</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=accountability">Accountability</a>
is a word that&#8217;s getting tossed around a lot lately. You hear people saying
things like:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>That developer should be held accountable for the validation problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The tester should be accountable for not finding that bug.</p></li>
<li><p>BP needs to be accountable for destroying an ecosystem.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The term seems to be thrown around most often when parts of a system fail. BP
is part of a larger industry which that&#8217;s regulated. The government agency
responsible for monitoring safety measures is responsible for ensuring they
follow safety regulations. So when BP made their <a href="http://twitter.com/bpglobalpr/status/14583761878">whoopsie
daisy</a>, the fingers were
pointed squarely at them. However, where were the regulators? There were tons
of opportunities for the government to push feedback to BP regarding the
safety of their operation. But it seemed like no one was talking.</p>

<p>The development process is strikingly similar. Any development team worth
their bits has a process that puts any issue in front of at least two parties
at all times. Joel Spolsky&#8217;s infamous <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html">Bug
1203</a>, a quick
story about the interactions between a dev and a tester, is the picture of
accountability, and shows that without active management and constant feedback
being exchanged, <strong>things don&#8217;t get done</strong>.</p>

<p>A quick synopsis and commentary: Jill the tester finds a bug, and provides
feedback to the dev team via the ticket system. In doing so, Jill has started
the feedback loop, and made it the responsibility of the dev team to
investigate the issue. The dev team, as they are prone to doing, deny
responsibility for the issue, and mark the issue as &#8216;NOT A BUG&#8217; Having done
so, they&#8217;ve put the onus on Jill to prove it&#8217;s <em>really</em> a bug, which she does
(probably in about 2 seconds). It&#8217;s again the responsibility of the dev team
to fix the bug, which they do. Jill confirms the fix, and thereby closes the
loop.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s important to realize is that in this type of process, it is the
responsibility of anyone and everyone involved to be accountable for their
role, and be focused on pushing feedback to the next person. Once there&#8217;s a
break in the loop, the issue is likely to be dropped, and never fixed. The
last person holding the ball is the screwup. I&#8217;m sure someone somewhere is
really upset they didn&#8217;t ask BP about that little safety measure.</p>

			I&#8217;ll Buy Time Any Day.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Many people value money as the most important thing in life, and will gladly
trade time for it. The pursuit of saving money is an extremely American one.
People will spend time in line for free stuff, just because it&#8217;s free.
Motorists getting tickets will spend days in court, just to avoid a fine.
Clipping coupons has become an art form, and even extended to the digital
world in the form of sites like <a href="http://slickdeals.net/">SlickDeals</a> and
<a href="http://www.groupon.com/">Groupon</a>.</p>

<p>Me, I like time. To me, time is way more valuable than the almighty dollar.
Reason: I can&#8217;t get it back. <strong>Evar.</strong></p>

<p>If I get a parking ticket, I know that if I pony up that those 55 greenbacks,
chances are there will be a check with my name on it in the next couple of
weeks that puts that those 55 American pesos back in my pocket. If went to
court, I&#8217;d never get back that 3-4 hours of my life. I&#8217;d also probably lose
the case. I&#8217;d also probably spend that time sitting next to someone who smells
like cheese. Paying up gives me a net gain of 3-4 hours of my life, which I
could spend doing stuff I like.</p>

<p>Being on a development team in a startup is pretty much the same thing. Your
team should be focusing as much time as possible on actually developing your
product. That means doing the things unique to your business and focusing on
what your company decides it&#8217;s core competency should be. However, there&#8217;s
tons of work that is hard, time-consuming, and generally unpleasant. Not only
is it unpleasant, but it can be incredibly time-consuming, because chances
are, you&#8217;re not good at it, or find it kind of icky. Leave that stuff to
someone else. Even better, find someone who likes doing that stuff and pay
them to do it.</p>

<p>In the cloud-infested webscape that exists today, there are any number of
companies that have decided that their core competency is something
specialized that you probably need. Companies that specialize in <a href="http://rackspace.com">IT
management</a>, <a href="http://encoding.com">video encoding</a>,
<a href="http://dynect.com">DNS</a>,
<a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files">storage</a>,
<a href="http://recurly.com/">billing</a>, etc. all exist and are willing to accept a
chunk of your cold hard cash to provide a service. The most important thing to
realize, is that if time is of the essence (and it always is), you&#8217;re not just
buying a service, you&#8217;re also buying the time it would take to you to build
that service yourself. So don&#8217;t be a crafty coupon-clipper and build it
yourself. Buy back that precious, precious time and spend it doing something
you really like.</p>

		<a href="/2010/05/31/death-of-the-ctr/">
		
			Death of the CTR</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since the dawn of online advertising, the gold standard of effectiveness has
been the CTR. This has made a lot of sense, since for the first time ever,
adertisers could leverage technology to figure out <em>exactly</em> how well they
were communicating. A user would click, and that click would be recorded. The
total number of clicks is compared against the total number of ads that are
put on the screen, and bingo, you know exactly how effective the campaign was.
Combine that number with more advanced analytics, such as tracking the user
past the initial click, onto the advertiser&#8217;s site, and onto really
interesting places, like the confirmation page of an ecommerce site. This gave
advertisers really effective ways to quantify the effectiveness of a campaign.</p>

<p>What has been more difficult to quantify is the value of advertising in
creating engagement and awareness. Simply seeing a brand association between
host site and banner advertisement creates awareness of a brand. Seeing a
banner ad doesn&#8217;t necessarily trigger immediate reactions (clicks), but can
trigger actions of the user later. Users may be inclined to purchase products
later on because of the brand awareness created by seeing banner ads. This is
awesome for advertisers, who get a return, albeit indirect, from banner
advertising, but it&#8217;s far less awesome for publishers. That publisher put a
great deal of work to create content that people want to see, and advertising
fees are very common way of monetizng that work. However, CPMs are commonly
determined by CTR. If that publisher has a lousy CTR, as a result of something
terrible, like having a savvy demographic that knows <em>not</em> to click on ads,
then that publisher suffers.</p>

<p>Microsoft has long been a proponent of <a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/research/engagement-mapping">measuring
engagement</a>, and
Google has recently mentioned rolling out tools that will track a user across
sessions on multiple sites. It&#8217;s clear that the industry needs to move in this
direction, although hopefully it will move slowly and find ways to avoid
becoming a ubiquitous, Minority Report-style system where Skynet knows who you
are, and will show you ads for Banana Republic after you&#8217;ve purchased khakis
from the Gap. However, the rewards for publishers could be great if the larger
players in the industry were able to track users across websites, and even
devices.</p>

			MySQL Slave Delay and Maatkit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This post could alternately be titled: &#8216;How to make developers hate you.&#8217;</p>

<p>A very common criticism of MySQL is that there is no support for delayed
replication. Delaying data flowing from master to slave can be very useful in
certain cases. For example, running a co-located slave for backups is still
susceptible to data problems that caused by a DELETE with no where or a
mistaken executed DROP. However, by running the slave anywhere from an hour to
a day behind, you have the opportunity to catch whatever problems caused and
have a good copy of your data ready to go.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2010/02/22/sandboxes/">sandbox environments</a>, a
consistent slave delay is a great way to reproduce race conditions. In fact,
running slave delay gives you the opportunity to ensure that data will be out
of sync between the master and slave. When you can count on this part of the
environment, developers can test and write code against this condition. Of
course, in reality, working in this type of environment is reaally annoying,
but necessary.</p>

<p>Delayed MySQL replication can be accomplished by using a tool from the
<a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">maatkit</a> library. Documentation for the tool can be
found at <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/doc/mk-slave-delay.html">[http://www.maatkit.org/doc/mk-slave-
delay.html](http://www.maatkit.org/doc/mk-slave-
delay.html)</a>. What&#8217;s great
about this tool is that can be run as a daemon, so that it can be easily run
for an extended period of time, without have to do any serious management.</p>

			MySQL Skip-name-resolve</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Small, obscure optimizations sometimes have the potential to make the greatest
impact. For example, every time a connection is made, MySQL will do a
<a href="http://l.chr.ishenry.com/mbukt">DNS</a> lookup of the host that is trying to
connect. If MySQL is handling many connections, the overhead of an extra DNS
lookup can be hefty, simply because of the number of extra operations that
have to be performed before MySQL can actually start doing actual <em>work</em>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there is an option in recent versions (4.1+) of MySQL that will
instruct MySQL to skip the extra DNS lookup. It&#8217;s a fairly obscure option
called <a href="http://l.chr.ishenry.com/elgrt">skip-name-resolve</a>. The only caveat to
using this option is that the users defined the GRANT tables can only use IP
addresses as hostnames. For most MySQL users, this shouldn&#8217;t be an issue.</p>

		<a href="/2010/02/22/sandboxes/">
		
			Sandboxes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Setting up a sandbox environment has normally been a trivial task. Set up a
vhost, get a copy of the database, build out the app, and start doing stuff.
When &#8216;Stuff&#8217; is &#8216;Done&#8217; push the changes onto production, and bask in your own
crapulence. That is, until your data set exceeds the limits of the sandbox,
and the <a href="http://l.chr.ishenry.com/bbhcu">SOA</a> which is saving the day in
production is becoming nothing but a headache in development.</p>

<p>The basic sandbox environment for an app includes a reasonably recent data
set, similar ( underpowered can be OK, depending ) hardware, the exact same
versions of php, mysql and apache. Php, mysql and apache need to be configured
exactly the same way as in production. In fact, as part of this process, it
might be useful to pull down those ever so important configuration files, put
them in a safe place. Perhaps source control (cough). Consistent configuration
is <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> important. Bugs produced by configuration problems are
notoriously hard to reproduce, and result in devs combing through code looking
for bugs that don&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>Maintaining a few sandboxes should be a trivial endeavor. That is, until your
project gets too big. A natural response to handling ever-growing problems is
use a Service Oriented Architecture; that is, to shard off aspects of the app
and dedicate hardware and resources to it. However, three or four shards
later, multiplied by an environment for each developer, the guy who was doing
sys admin work as needed just became full timer. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no way
around this, even with a clever sys admin, who can leave enough automated
scripts around so that developers can <em>mostly</em> maintain their own environment.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is maintaining the development environment is one of
the most important things a company can do. Close attention to detail in the
sandbox will make all the difference in the deployment process. Changes in
code base, file permissions and configuration can all be tested and deployed
the same as in production. So every build to every sandbox (everyone builds
daily, right?) is a chance for the development team to catch mistakes, and
learn from them, before the big push. And if that fails, we all know how to
handle a <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2009/05/25/crisis-mo/">crisis</a>.</p>

gets done later. Some tasks that go over deadline result in profanities and

expiration date. As in, if it doesn&#8217;t get done by a certain time, it doesn&#8217;t

<p>What Big John was referring to was the fact that all he had to do was ignore
Cole and Rowdy until they didn&#8217;t any fight left in them. Tasks can be just the
same way. Eventually, the need for the task to be done just goes away, or
starts to smell. The only thing that really matters is being able to tell the
difference between the things that <strong>really</strong> need to get done, and the things
that just aren&#8217;t important enough to get done.</p>

			Sphinx Full Text Search Engine</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For a very long time, I was convinced that a FULLTEXT index in MySQL was the
best solution for all your searching needs. Then I realized that it was
horribly slow, and mixing with complex joins completely destroyed any chances
of using MySQL indexes in any way that would make sense or get decent results.
The solution to fast and scalable free text search on any website is, of
course, a Full Text search engine.</p>

<p>There are a few different ones out there. After a brief affair with Lucene, I
settled on Sphinx. Sphinx is easy to install, even on 64-bit machines, and is
architected in a way that makes a lot of sense for the web. The following
steps were performed on a Red Hat machine. Don&#8217;t skip the mysql-dev install,
even if you already MySQL installed.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Sphinx installation  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>yum install gcc-c++
</span><span class='line'>yum install mysql-dev*
</span><span class='line'>wget http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-0.9.9.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>tar xzvf sphinx-0.9.9.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>mkdir /usr/local/sphinx
</span><span class='line'>./configure --prefix /usr/local/sphinx --with-mysql&gt; ./make
</span><span class='line'>make install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once installed, it&#8217;s fairly simple to start playing with the packaged example
data and queries. The php APIs make integration easy, either to build a
service, or use locally as a substitute for MySQL. In fact, as long as the
index can be kept reasonably up to date, Sphinx is a better choice for
complicated sorts than MySQL.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Having your own domain and server is a really fun thing. You can keep a blog,
store files, post photos. All good ole down-home interwebz fun you can dream
up. With the advent of micro-blogging, everyone now has an audience they need
to communicate with in the briefest fashion.</p>

<p>Short links have become the norm for sharing, but with a huge price. Short
links break the interconnectedness of the Internet. Search results that depend
on the count of links become incorrect. Some services try to reconnect links
between domains by using some DNS trickery. But the issue remains that there
is a middleman that can&#8217;t help make the connection.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, that middleman is the search engine. Google&#8217;s recently
announced URL shortener could solve many of the problems inherent with URL
shorteners. By being the middleman, Google would have all the necessary
information to put the pieces back together. It&#8217;s easy enough to set up,
provided you have a Google Apps account. It does not currently have an API,
but here&#8217;s hoping.</p>
