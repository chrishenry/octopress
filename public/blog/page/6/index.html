		<p>I am pleased to announce that this site is now hosted on the <a href="http://bit.ly/4LrOTd">Rackspace
Cloud</a>. It was a simple migration from MediaTemple, and
has given me the level of control I want. I got to choose my OS (CentOS),
versions of php and MySQL, and setup apache how I like it. I&#8217;m free of Plesk
and those and the limitations therein.</p>

<p>The one thing I would really like to see from the Rackspace Cloud is DNS
Support. My goal when migrating
<a href="http://chr.ishenry.com">[http://chr.ishenry.com](http://chr.ishenry.com)</a> was
to move entirely off of MediaTemple. The one thing I really did like about
hosting with them was that DNS was integrated directly into the service. With
the Rackspace Cloud, there was no such convenience. However, a quick signup
with <a href="http://bit.ly/8AYkxJ">DynDNS</a> and a tweak to my domain registrar solved
that.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Ryan Kearney&#8217;s <a href="http://bit.ly/8YZtH3">video tutorial</a> for the
yum command that brought everything together.</p>

			Rackspace Downtime</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>[Update] My team at Rackspace has sent me the fluffiest, most comfortable
pillow I have ever had.</p>

<p>When a hosting provider goes down, there are lots of questions that get
raised. Is my host reliable? Will they flake out during crucial times when my
site needs the traffic? Will they <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dreamhost+billing">double
bill</a> me?</p>

<p>Since I have been working with Rackspace, they have had less than stellar
uptime, with issues mostly related to power. My company pays a lot for hosting
with them, and downtime for a young company is deadly. But oddly enough, I&#8217;m
still OK with Rackspace hosting my company&#8217;s myriad services. The benefits of
hosting with them have been so great that a couple hours of downtime is
nothing.</p>

<p>First off, their SLA has provisions for downtime, when it happens. If your
server has a legitimate issue, you&#8217;re entitled to ask for a credit. To me,
this is a promise that they&#8217;ll put their money where their mouth is. And if
you call them on it, they&#8217;ll be reasonable.</p>

<p>Secondly, their support during crises is still amazing. During the <a href="http://bit.ly/9LrNz">truck
incident</a>, I was able to get a tech to run fsck on my
disks, and hang out to watch no questions asked. No, I am not on their
intensive plan.</p>

<p>Third, their support culture is simply amazing. Their linux techs are always
willing to look deep into an issue to find a resolution, and they provide much
of the basic <a href="http://bit.ly/1HkKYJ">infrastructure</a> that is hard to come by
for small companies.. They&#8217;re also completely willing to educate their
customers about the servers they maintain.</p>

<p>In short, Rackspace has been the target of a lot of criticism over issues in
their datacenters. The fact of the matter is that there will always be issues
and downtime. <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/solutions/managed_hosting/s%0Aupport/servicelevels/managedsla.php">Their SLA</a> guarantees the impossible, which they
seem to realize, as any failure on their part comes with swift response. In
the end their SLA seems to be more of a way of setting standards than anything
else.</p>

<p>[Full disclosure: I haven&#8217;t slept in 2 days because of their power issues]</p>

			Fix or Manage?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes bugs come along that require significant work to fix. Depending on
what project timelines are like at the moment, sometimes fixing the bug isn&#8217;t
the best option. For example, a race condition in the caching architecture
causes pages to be stale. The persistent data store is correct, but the cache
is not. To the person who just triggered the update, there&#8217;s a bug. The
information on the public side is not in sync with the information they just
entered.</p>

<p>So, like any other bug, a report will eventually percolate down to the dev
team. People scream, fortunes are lost, the svn blame command is used, and the
devs who wrote the code pee their pants. Once the chaos dies down, the actual
prognosis of this issue can turn out to be extremely grim.</p>

<p>A shortcoming of the caching architecture shows that there&#8217;s a race condition
when the system is under heavy load. In order to fix it, the dev team needs to
plumb the depths of the data access layer, and probably change some
parameters. But that&#8217;ll probably break everything. Everywhere. Or the layer
manipulating the data could be fixed to replace the cache instead of
invalidating. Except the methods to manipulate that entity live in 3 different
codebases. It&#8217;ll probably break the editor. Either way, the actual solution
doesn&#8217;t matter.The dev team certainly needs to do something, and it needs to
be released three days ago.</p>

<p>The correct way to fix this issue will vary widely depending on circumstances.
But in this particular case, the best answer was to <strong>not fix it, just manage
it</strong>. Our team was busy, there were other projects that were more pressing.
Plus the codebase was being rewritten. So instead of flogging a dead horse, a
simple script was thrown together that compared the cache and the database. If
they were out of sync, the cache would be cleared, and would be repopulated
with the correct information the next time it was requested. Once it was
implemented, the bug was still there, but the cache <em>seemed</em> to be up to date.</p>

<p>Every dev team will face bugs that have enormous costs to fix. The way to deal
with these bugs will be different every time they come up. It&#8217;s important to
remember that managing bugs can be almost as effective as fixing them.</p>

			What&#8217;s in a Name?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in semantics. Figuring out the best names for
variables, tables, columns, classes, etc is something that can eat up hours or
even days of a development schedule. The idea is that the more precise the
name, the better it is. The arguments for precision naming are many :</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear names help other developers read your code.<em> New developers who come on will immediately understand what&#8217;s happening</em> Calling well named methods of classes will read like sentence, further increasing readability.* Clear names will be able to help developers relate things in the UI to the code.</li>
</ul>


<p>Keep in mind, I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_naming_convention">naming
conventions</a>.
Naming conventions are simply rules for choosing the character sequences. They
don&#8217;t dictate what words you should assign to things in your code.</p>

<p>Whatever names developers choose, they will get strewn throughout the layers
of the application. Database, table and column names will be impacted.
Variables in server-side scripts. Organization of classes into folders.
Javascript file names. Memcache keys. URLs. Just like sand at the beach, the
labels the dev team decided on goes everywhere you can think of. Invariably,
the marketing team will bound down the hall, and announce the product is being
rebranded. Jobs will become Gigs. Friends will become Followers. Application
code will become confusing.</p>

<p>New devs won&#8217;t get it anyway.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is overthinking naming is a good way to get nowhere
fast. Keeping it simple and just take enough time to make sure that things
make sense will give devs more time to focus on important stuff. Like being
able to articulate the thought <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2009/07/01/explain-your-code/">process behind
code</a>.</p>

			Blackberry OS Will Never Take Over the World</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few days ago, I installed <a href="http://www.opera.com/mini/">Opera Mini</a> on my
Blackberry Curve. The experience offered by Opera Mini is really impressive.
It retrieves and renders pages quickly and flawlessly. The interface is
specifically designed to handle navigating long pages on a tiny screen. In
short, it&#8217;s a great app, and a major improvement on the Blackberry Browser.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the catch (or catches). Links that appear in other applications won&#8217;t
open in Opera, they&#8217;ll open in the Blackberry browser. What&#8217;s worse is that
Opera&#8217;s location bar does not have an option to paste links directly into the
location bar. In order to paste a link into the location bar, you need to hit
the symbol key, which brings up an edit screen pre-populated with &#8216;www.&#8217; You
need to erase the www, and <em>then</em> you can paste your link in.</p>

<p>That lengthy process completely kills any satisfaction you may get out of
having a workable browser on a Blackberry. And none of it is Opera&#8217;s fault. On
most other OSes, clicking URLs in any application will fire up the default
browser and retrieve the URL. Hell, on iPhone OS, you can set up protocol
handlers that will open up other apps. Hopefully RIM will provide a means for
applications to talk to each other soon. Creating the seamless interaction
between apps is probably even more important than pushing App World.</p>

			Gearman</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Users have high expectations of web apps in terms of performance,
responsiveness and tons of features. Normally, you&#8217;re only allowed two of any
list of three really cool things. In the case of Web Apps, that would be true.
Most will find some compromise of between performance / responsiveness and
tons of features. More features usually equals less responsiveness, depending
on the feature and scale.</p>

<p>Enter Gearman. <a href="http://bit.ly/1Wrot">Gearman</a> is a queuing system that allows
work to be farmed out to other servers. Most importantly, it allows for
intense tasks to be queued and performed in the background. This means that
when a user performs an action that could potentially take a long time
(sending notification emails, updating Full Text indexes, etc), that slow task
can be queued to run in the background, and the page can be sent to the user,
keeping things snappy.</p>

<p>Gearman is pretty simple to install on Red Hat.</p>

<p>download gearman from server> wget <a href="http://launchpad.net/gearmand/trunk/0.8/+download%0A/gearmand-0.8.tar.gz">http://launchpad.net/gearmand/trunk/0.8/+d
ownload/gearmand-0.8.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>unzip and move into the directory> tar -xvzf gearmand-0.8.tar.gz> cd
gearmand-0.8</p>

<p>Red Hat didn&#8217;t have some dependencies. The next few steps will vary depending
on your *nix distro.</p>

<p>Install the libevent developer library.> yum install libevent-devel</p>

<p>Install the e2fsprogs developer library> yum install e2fsprogs-devel</p>

<p>configure and install> ./configure> make> make install</p>

<p>/<strong> Net Gearman </strong>/</p>

<p>download php extension from the pecl repo> wget <a href="http://pecl.php.net/get/gearman-0.4.0.tgz">http://pecl.php.net/get/gearm
an-0.4.0.tgz</a></p>

<p>untar> tar -xvf gearman-0.4.0.tgz</p>

<p>build the extension> phpize> ./configure> make> make test> make install</p>

<p>Add the extension to the php.ini</p>

<p>[gearman]extension=gearman.so</p>

<p>And you&#8217;re all set!</p>

<p>Integration will depend on if you decide to use the php extension, and how
encapsulated the code base is. I highly recommend using the pecl extension, as
it provides great implementations of the client and worker. <a href="http://bit.ly/TunGR"> and Gearman will
save you.</a></p>

		<a href="/2009/07/16/save-mysql/">
		
			Save MySQL</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Runaway queries on MySQL can be a real problem. If a long-running query locks
up important tables, other queries trying to query the table will will placed
in a queue. Each new query is a new connection to MySQL. Once you hit
max_connections, your MySQL connection code will start to fail. Depending on
how errors are handled at this stage of the request, this could mean total
disaster for a site.</p>

<p>Although there is no way to fix this within the MySQL server itself, a bit of
clever scripting can be run via cron to check if there is a problem.
Presenting : save_mysql</p>

<p>/usr/bin/mysql -e &#8216;show full processlist \G;&#8217; 2> /dev/null |grep -A1 -B5 -E
&#8220;Time: [1-9][0-9][0-9]?&#8221; |grep -E &#8220;Id\:\ |State\:\ &#8221; |/usr/bin/perl -n -e
&#8220;if( $. % 2 ) { chomp $<em>;print $</em>; } else { print $_; }&#8221; |grep -E &#8220;\ State\:\
Sending\ data$|\ State\:\ Sorting\ result$&#8221; |awk {&#8216;print $2&#8217;} |xargs -iTHREAD
-r -n1 /usr/bin/mysqladmin kill THREAD &amp;> /dev/null</p>

<p>/usr/bin/mysql -e &#8216;show full processlist \G;&#8217; 2> /dev/nullThis line will grab
a list of all the currently running queries and commands from the MySQL
server. It also redirects any error output to the blackhole. It produces
output like so:</p>

<pre><code>*************************** 1. row ***************************Id: 842863User: adminHost: localhostdb: NULLCommand: QueryTime: 0State: NULLInfo: show full processlist
</code></pre>

<p>grep -A1 -B5 -E &#8220;Time: [1-9][0-9][0-9]?&#8221;The grep here will grab line directly
below and the 5 above if the time is over 100 seconds. This line can be
tweaked to grep for less time. My preference is between 30 seconds and a
minute. So instead of[1-9][0-9][0-9]you&#8217;d have[3-9][0-9] (30 seconds) OR
[6-9][0-9] (60 seconds)</p>

<p>grep -E &#8220;Id\:\ |State\:\ &#8220;This will filter out the other lines from the
previous grep and just grab the MySQL process ID and it&#8217;s State.</p>

<p>/usr/bin/perl -n -e &#8220;if( $. % 2 ) { chomp $<em>;print $</em>; } else { print $_;
}&#8221;Quick Perl script to put id and state from the step above on the same line.</p>

<p>grep -E &#8220;\ State\:\ Sending\ data$|\ State\:\ Sorting\ result$&#8221;This line will
filter out the queries being run that are in the state &#8216;Sending Data&#8217; or
&#8216;Sorting Result&#8217;. These are both states where it&#8217;s safe to kill the query.</p>

<p>awk {&#8216;print $2&#8217;}This line grabs the query ID from the output.</p>

<p>xargs -iTHREAD -r -n1 /usr/bin/mysqladmin kill THREAD &amp;> /dev/nullLastly, this
line will grab the ID from above to the mysqladmin kill command, effectively
killing the query.</p>

			Do One Thing, but Do It Really Well</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In life there are people who will consider themselves Jacks of all Trades. But
as the saying goes, they are master of none.</p>

<p>Websites will always start out as a codebase that does everything. There will
be a couple files that add users, encode video to Flash, pull rss feeds,
assemble HTML, update products, charge users, manipulate images, redirect old
links, handle file uploads, calculate shipping, delete categories, create rss
feeds, search the database, etc. Sometimes the code to do these will be
organized into files, sometimes it won&#8217;t. The whole site will run on a single
server, or more likely, a slice of a single server.</p>

<p>None of the things in the above list will be done well. None. This is mostly
because there is too little code and too little hardware focused on doing too
much. Also, every piece of code will be tightly coupled. So any one of those
features could potentially get a ton of traffic, or hit a bump, and consume a
ton of resources. Once that happens, it&#8217;s safe to assume the whole thing will
go down in flames.</p>

<p>So to avoid the Fail Whale, its really important to build sites as a group of
components that work together. <a href="http://bit.ly/TunGR">Architecture</a> is key, and
when carefully thought out, can ensure that the most important parts of the
site stay up. Even when your image manipulation script on the backend freaks
out, the home page should continue to load flawlessly.</p>

<p>With database-driven apps (almost every major site on the web), there needs to
be particular attention paid to a caching layer. Again, since most sites start
out with a jumbled codebase, the likelihood that all the code to manage data
is in the same place is unlikely. Given the complexities of managing cache
objects, making sure that objects are invalidated on update is crucial to
making updates look seamless. So there needs to be a set of code that&#8217;s good
at one thing: managing data and its cache.</p>

<p>Search is another area that commonly relies on database, and can eat a ton of
resources. If performing search in SQL, difficult queries can lock tables and
keep other queries from being answered. As good as some DBMSes have gotten at
handling search ( ie MySQL&#8217;s FULLTEXT ), they still can&#8217;t fulfill the
concurrency demands of a site with heavy traffic. So, again, the solution is a
change where a resource intensice feature needs to be isolated from other
code. There are a few different ways to do this. One is running replication,
which may not be possible in smaller hosting environments. Another is to use
Full Text Search (Lucene, Sphinx, etc.) Again, this may not be possible in
smaller hosting environments.</p>

<p>Using code that&#8217;s already good at managing and retrieving data, an interface
can be built to query your data. A second hosting environment that&#8217;s suitable
for running the search tool of your choice can then query the data code for
updates it needs to keep itself updated. In turn, this server will return
search results without tying up any resources necessary for doing important
stuff, like serving the home page.</p>

<p>So in these two short examples, we&#8217;ve created a theoretical architecture that
can sustain heavy, site-breaking traffic to the search, and still continue to
serve the home page. Of course, until the Apache server becomes so inundated
with requests that it can&#8217;t do anything. Then it&#8217;s time to get that load
balancer in place…</p>

determining factors. During an interview, I will always make the same request:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us a code sample. It can be something that you think is really great, or
something you think really sucks. Most importantly, tell us why you think it&#8217;s
great, or why you think it sucks.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one seems to able to do it. I have received code samples that consist of
stream wrappers, database wrappers, complete websites, etc. Some have been
really good, and some have been outright scary. But very few candidates have
been able to communicate what they think of their own code and why.</p>

<p>Which is very surprising, given most developers&#8217; proclivity to judge others&#8217;
code as total crap without a second thought (guilty).</p>

			Zombie Projects</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A Zombie Project is any project that has been completed for a while but needs
to be changed or updated in some way. After laying dormant for a while, the
team that developed it may have left, or evolved into a different team, or
changed their methodology entirely.</p>

<p>While the project was dormant, it is extremely likely, if not definite that
knee-jerk reactions to bugs have caused changes that no one remembers, much
less committed. So when development starts on the project sandbox, if it still
exists, it is more likely than not that everything is out of date. In this
case, bite the bullet. FTP the whole codebase down, and check it against the
repo. Your life will probably be miserable for a bit, but at least there won&#8217;t
be any horrible surprises later. Also, if there&#8217;s a sandbox, triple check it.
If not, be glad there&#8217;s nothing you&#8217;ll miss in an old one.</p>

<p>If this project is only being opened for a short period, resist the urge to
make small changes in methodology or framework. For every small change you
make, you&#8217;ll want to make another, and update this, and modify that. Be
extremely careful of the budget, and cost of each change, or you&#8217;re done for.</p>

<p>Lastly, be very, very afraid of the build to production. Even with fastidious
notes, a sys admin with OCD, and Gillian the QA girl telling you how awesome
you are, assume you missed something. An open tail of the error log is your
best visibility into whatever has reared it&#8217;s ugly head. Your next best bet is
your trusty <a href="http://bit.ly/96yBC">Crisis MO</a>.</p>
