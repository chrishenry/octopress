			Sphinx Full Text Search Engine</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For a very long time, I was convinced that a FULLTEXT index in MySQL was the
best solution for all your searching needs. Then I realized that it was
horribly slow, and mixing with complex joins completely destroyed any chances
of using MySQL indexes in any way that would make sense or get decent results.
The solution to fast and scalable free text search on any website is, of
course, a Full Text search engine.</p>

<p>There are a few different ones out there. After a brief affair with Lucene, I
settled on Sphinx. Sphinx is easy to install, even on 64-bit machines, and is
architected in a way that makes a lot of sense for the web. The following
steps were performed on a Red Hat machine. Don&#8217;t skip the mysql-dev install,
even if you already MySQL installed.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Sphinx installation  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>yum install gcc-c++
</span><span class='line'>yum install mysql-dev*
</span><span class='line'>wget http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-0.9.9.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>tar xzvf sphinx-0.9.9.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>mkdir /usr/local/sphinx
</span><span class='line'>./configure --prefix /usr/local/sphinx --with-mysql&gt; ./make
</span><span class='line'>make install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once installed, it&#8217;s fairly simple to start playing with the packaged example
data and queries. The php APIs make integration easy, either to build a
service, or use locally as a substitute for MySQL. In fact, as long as the
index can be kept reasonably up to date, Sphinx is a better choice for
complicated sorts than MySQL.</p>

			Google Short Links</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Having your own domain and server is a really fun thing. You can keep a blog,
store files, post photos. All good ole down-home interwebz fun you can dream
up. With the advent of micro-blogging, everyone now has an audience they need
to communicate with in the briefest fashion.</p>

<p>Short links have become the norm for sharing, but with a huge price. Short
links break the interconnectedness of the Internet. Search results that depend
on the count of links become incorrect. Some services try to reconnect links
between domains by using some DNS trickery. But the issue remains that there
is a middleman that can&#8217;t help make the connection.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, that middleman is the search engine. Google&#8217;s recently
announced URL shortener could solve many of the problems inherent with URL
shorteners. By being the middleman, Google would have all the necessary
information to put the pieces back together. It&#8217;s easy enough to set up,
provided you have a Google Apps account. It does not currently have an API,
but here&#8217;s hoping.</p>

			30 Seconds to Mars :: This Is War</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>30 Seconds to Mars recently released their third album, This is War, and it is
quite the departure from their first album. Brand New Day was raw and angry,
with amazing guitar sounds, great composition, and a real sense of urgency in
the writing. The album was really exciting to listen to, and the live
performances were great. I saw them at Avalon in NYC a few years ago, and it&#8217;s
still one of my all time favorite shows.</p>

<p>This is War is mild and boring in comparison. The effects driven distorted
guitars characteristic to Brand New Day is missing. They seem to have been
replaced with over-produced electronics. Jared Leto has less than half the
intensity than he did in Brand New Day, and the lyrics have lost their edge.
The focus on deeply layered choruses of what sounds like children singing
lacks impact. The collaboration with Kanye and his 808 didn&#8217;t really go
anywhere, and just seemed to pull the band further from their roots. It&#8217;s sad
to hear a band that had such a great band with a unique sound has gone so far
off track.</p>

			Changing Criteria</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Occasionally, a project will come across my plate with the criteria, &#8216;Make
sure this works everywhere, is completely template-able, and is something we
can grow with.&#8217; Normally this is coupled with &#8216;We need this to work with X
<em>right now</em>, and Y and Z later.&#8217; What I really hear is &#8216;Make it work for X,
and <a href="http://bit.ly/6kpqUc">ship </a> the damn thing.&#8217; After all, hitting those
deadlines is <strong>really</strong> important.</p>

<p>Of course, this has a whole bunch of ugly assumptions tied to it. The first
is: when I get to Y, everything I did for X will work. All I need to do is
drop in a few config changes, and tweak a few parameters, and I&#8217;m done. (Yea,
right) Secondly: that every case Y needs to cover is contained within X. (Not
Likely) Third: All of this will be so well documented that any literate
individual will be able to implement Y by osmosis.</p>

<p>So. Do we spend time now or later? Shipping X seems pretty simple, so why not
just build X, satisfy the business dude and call it a day. Spending time now
means that deadlines may have to shift, and something that should be simple
becomes complex. We have other, more important, projects to work on.</p>

<p>Eventually Y comes calling. So let me introduce you toâ€¦Future Web Dev Guy
Person Girl! If you&#8217;re lucky, that person is you. If you&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s another
dev. The assumptions we made back in paragraph 2 have reared their ugly heads.
Since they were assumptions, you&#8217;re probably boned. If not, you&#8217;re probably
one of <a href="http://www.ioinformatics.org/photo/images/p4.jpg">these guys</a>. If
you&#8217;re the rest of us, Future Web Dev Guy Person Girl definitely hates your
guts, because the groundwork that was supposed to be laid out is not there.
They&#8217;re running through a lice-infested rat&#8217;s nest of procedural functions
trying to pass the additional variable that will make this all work.</p>

<p>The best way to keep Future Web Dev Guy Person Girl from cursing like a sailor
is implement correctly, test thoroughly, and deal with Y before it&#8217;s due.
Deadlines need to be managed according to project scope, and if project scope
includes Y, it needs to be accounted for now, before you lose a friend in
Future Web Dev Guy Person Girl.</p>

			The Technician, Now on a Cloud Server</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am pleased to announce that this site is now hosted on the <a href="http://bit.ly/4LrOTd">Rackspace
Cloud</a>. It was a simple migration from MediaTemple, and
has given me the level of control I want. I got to choose my OS (CentOS),
versions of php and MySQL, and setup apache how I like it. I&#8217;m free of Plesk
and those and the limitations therein.</p>

<p>The one thing I would really like to see from the Rackspace Cloud is DNS
Support. My goal when migrating
<a href="http://chr.ishenry.com">[http://chr.ishenry.com](http://chr.ishenry.com)</a> was
to move entirely off of MediaTemple. The one thing I really did like about
hosting with them was that DNS was integrated directly into the service. With
the Rackspace Cloud, there was no such convenience. However, a quick signup
with <a href="http://bit.ly/8AYkxJ">DynDNS</a> and a tweak to my domain registrar solved
that.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Ryan Kearney&#8217;s <a href="http://bit.ly/8YZtH3">video tutorial</a> for the
yum command that brought everything together.</p>

			Rackspace Downtime</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>[Update] My team at Rackspace has sent me the fluffiest, most comfortable
pillow I have ever had.</p>

<p>When a hosting provider goes down, there are lots of questions that get
raised. Is my host reliable? Will they flake out during crucial times when my
site needs the traffic? Will they <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dreamhost+billing">double
bill</a> me?</p>

<p>Since I have been working with Rackspace, they have had less than stellar
uptime, with issues mostly related to power. My company pays a lot for hosting
with them, and downtime for a young company is deadly. But oddly enough, I&#8217;m
still OK with Rackspace hosting my company&#8217;s myriad services. The benefits of
hosting with them have been so great that a couple hours of downtime is
nothing.</p>

<p>First off, their SLA has provisions for downtime, when it happens. If your
server has a legitimate issue, you&#8217;re entitled to ask for a credit. To me,
this is a promise that they&#8217;ll put their money where their mouth is. And if
you call them on it, they&#8217;ll be reasonable.</p>

<p>Secondly, their support during crises is still amazing. During the <a href="http://bit.ly/9LrNz">truck
incident</a>, I was able to get a tech to run fsck on my
disks, and hang out to watch no questions asked. No, I am not on their
intensive plan.</p>

<p>Third, their support culture is simply amazing. Their linux techs are always
willing to look deep into an issue to find a resolution, and they provide much
of the basic <a href="http://bit.ly/1HkKYJ">infrastructure</a> that is hard to come by
for small companies.. They&#8217;re also completely willing to educate their
customers about the servers they maintain.</p>

<p>In short, Rackspace has been the target of a lot of criticism over issues in
their datacenters. The fact of the matter is that there will always be issues
and downtime. <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/solutions/managed_hosting/s%0Aupport/servicelevels/managedsla.php">Their SLA</a> guarantees the impossible, which they
seem to realize, as any failure on their part comes with swift response. In
the end their SLA seems to be more of a way of setting standards than anything
else.</p>

<p>[Full disclosure: I haven&#8217;t slept in 2 days because of their power issues]</p>

			Fix or Manage?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes bugs come along that require significant work to fix. Depending on
what project timelines are like at the moment, sometimes fixing the bug isn&#8217;t
the best option. For example, a race condition in the caching architecture
causes pages to be stale. The persistent data store is correct, but the cache
is not. To the person who just triggered the update, there&#8217;s a bug. The
information on the public side is not in sync with the information they just
entered.</p>

<p>So, like any other bug, a report will eventually percolate down to the dev
team. People scream, fortunes are lost, the svn blame command is used, and the
devs who wrote the code pee their pants. Once the chaos dies down, the actual
prognosis of this issue can turn out to be extremely grim.</p>

<p>A shortcoming of the caching architecture shows that there&#8217;s a race condition
when the system is under heavy load. In order to fix it, the dev team needs to
plumb the depths of the data access layer, and probably change some
parameters. But that&#8217;ll probably break everything. Everywhere. Or the layer
manipulating the data could be fixed to replace the cache instead of
invalidating. Except the methods to manipulate that entity live in 3 different
codebases. It&#8217;ll probably break the editor. Either way, the actual solution
doesn&#8217;t matter.The dev team certainly needs to do something, and it needs to
be released three days ago.</p>

<p>The correct way to fix this issue will vary widely depending on circumstances.
But in this particular case, the best answer was to <strong>not fix it, just manage
it</strong>. Our team was busy, there were other projects that were more pressing.
Plus the codebase was being rewritten. So instead of flogging a dead horse, a
simple script was thrown together that compared the cache and the database. If
they were out of sync, the cache would be cleared, and would be repopulated
with the correct information the next time it was requested. Once it was
implemented, the bug was still there, but the cache <em>seemed</em> to be up to date.</p>

<p>Every dev team will face bugs that have enormous costs to fix. The way to deal
with these bugs will be different every time they come up. It&#8217;s important to
remember that managing bugs can be almost as effective as fixing them.</p>

			What&#8217;s in a Name?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in semantics. Figuring out the best names for
variables, tables, columns, classes, etc is something that can eat up hours or
even days of a development schedule. The idea is that the more precise the
name, the better it is. The arguments for precision naming are manyÂ :</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear names help other developers read your code.<em> New developers who come on will immediately understand what&#8217;s happening</em> Calling well named methods of classes will read like sentence, further increasing readability.* Clear names will be able to help developers relate things in the UI to the code.</li>
</ul>


<p>Keep in mind, I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_naming_convention">naming
conventions</a>.
Naming conventions are simply rules for choosing the character sequences. They
don&#8217;t dictate what words you should assign to things in your code.</p>

<p>Whatever names developers choose, they will get strewn throughout the layers
of the application. Database, table and column names will be impacted.
Variables in server-side scripts. Organization of classes into folders.
Javascript file names. Memcache keys. URLs. Just like sand at the beach, the
labels the dev team decided on goes everywhere you can think of. Invariably,
the marketing team will bound down the hall, and announce the product is being
rebranded. Jobs will become Gigs. Friends will become Followers. Application
code will become confusing.</p>

<p>New devs won&#8217;t get it anyway.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is overthinking naming is a good way to get nowhere
fast. Keeping it simple and just take enough time to make sure that things
make sense will give devs more time to focus on important stuff. Like being
able to articulate the thought <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2009/07/01/explain-your-code/">process behind
code</a>.</p>

			Blackberry OS Will Never Take Over the World</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few days ago, I installed <a href="http://www.opera.com/mini/">Opera Mini</a> on my
Blackberry Curve. The experience offered by Opera Mini is really impressive.
It retrieves and renders pages quickly and flawlessly. The interface is
specifically designed to handle navigating long pages on a tiny screen. In
short, it&#8217;s a great app, and a major improvement on the Blackberry Browser.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the catch (or catches). Links that appear in other applications won&#8217;t
open in Opera, they&#8217;ll open in the Blackberry browser. What&#8217;s worse is that
Opera&#8217;s location bar does not have an option to paste links directly into the
location bar. In order to paste a link into the location bar, you need to hit
the symbol key, which brings up an edit screen pre-populated with &#8216;www.&#8217; You
need to erase the www, and <em>then</em> you can paste your link in.</p>

<p>That lengthy process completely kills any satisfaction you may get out of
having a workable browser on a Blackberry. And none of it is Opera&#8217;s fault. On
most other OSes, clicking URLs in any application will fire up the default
browser and retrieve the URL. Hell, on iPhone OS, you can set up protocol
handlers that will open up other apps. Hopefully RIM will provide a means for
applications to talk to each other soon. Creating the seamless interaction
between apps is probably even more important than pushing App World.</p>

			Gearman</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Users have high expectations of web apps in terms of performance,
responsiveness and tons of features. Normally, you&#8217;re only allowed two of any
list of three really cool things. In the case of Web Apps, that would be true.
Most will find some compromise of between performance / responsiveness and
tons of features. More features usually equals less responsiveness, depending
on the feature and scale.</p>

<p>Enter Gearman. <a href="http://bit.ly/1Wrot">Gearman</a> is a queuing system that allows
work to be farmed out to other servers. Most importantly, it allows for
intense tasks to be queued and performed in the background. This means that
when a user performs an action that could potentially take a long time
(sending notification emails, updating Full Text indexes, etc), that slow task
can be queued to run in the background, and the page can be sent to the user,
keeping things snappy.</p>

<p>Gearman is pretty simple to install on Red Hat.</p>

<p>download gearman from server> wget <a href="http://launchpad.net/gearmand/trunk/0.8/+download%0A/gearmand-0.8.tar.gz">http://launchpad.net/gearmand/trunk/0.8/+d
ownload/gearmand-0.8.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>unzip and move into the directory> tar -xvzf gearmand-0.8.tar.gz> cd
gearmand-0.8</p>

<p>Red Hat didn&#8217;t have some dependencies. The next few steps will vary depending
on your *nix distro.</p>

<p>Install the libevent developer library.> yum install libevent-devel</p>

<p>Install the e2fsprogs developer library> yum install e2fsprogs-devel</p>

<p>configure and install> ./configure> make> make install</p>

<p>/<strong> Net Gearman </strong>/</p>

<p>download php extension from the pecl repo> wget <a href="http://pecl.php.net/get/gearman-0.4.0.tgz">http://pecl.php.net/get/gearm
an-0.4.0.tgz</a></p>

<p>untar> tar -xvf gearman-0.4.0.tgz</p>

<p>build the extension> phpize> ./configure> make> make test> make install</p>

<p>Add the extension to the php.ini</p>

<p>[gearman]extension=gearman.so</p>

<p>And you&#8217;re all set!</p>

<p>Integration will depend on if you decide to use the php extension, and how
encapsulated the code base is. I highly recommend using the pecl extension, as
it provides great implementations of the client and worker. <a href="http://bit.ly/TunGR"> and Gearman will
save you.</a></p>
