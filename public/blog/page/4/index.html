			Development Without Internet Access</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While flying to Austin for sxsw, I had a small programming task. Take a string
of a few search terms, break it apart and highlight those terms in another
string. It&#8217;s a straightforward task, and probably a wheel that&#8217;s been
reinvented thousands of time in the history of computer science. I approached
it as an exercise, to see if I could add another squeaky wheel to the pile. My
goal was to do it without using any 3rd party code or any resources. I had no
access to documentation, google, stack overflow, or any of the other resources
I use constantly to get my job done every day.</p>

<p>The code that I produced was bloated, naive, and horribly inefficient (I
suspect). While writing it, i knew I wasn&#8217;t really on the right path. When I
got back to New York, I took a look at it, and more or less decided I had
wasted my time. Then I realized I had written it on a plane, and had nothing
better to do. I simply got myself into the zone, and wanted to work through a
problem until it was solved. After I got over my initial disgust, I wondered
what aside from boredom and stubbornness had prompted me to complete the task.</p>

<p>I never really came to any conclusions until a few days later. I was going
about my day normally, fixing bugs, writing emails, troubleshooting. As I hit
a hard spot, something I couldn&#8217;t figure out, I gave up staring at the code,
and turned to Google. Then I came across a builtin php function that was
giving me a strange result. After puzzling for a few seconds, I dropped the
function into Google. A little while later, I was examining the results of an
EXPLAIN statement in MySQL, and the output was something I hadn&#8217;t seen before.
I found the answer on StackOverflow a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Then it dawned on me. Maybe I don&#8217;t actually have the skills to be a web
developer, and I&#8217;ve faked it all these years. Maybe I don&#8217;t know all that much
about MySQL, and perhaps I only know enough about Linux to cause problems for
Rackspace. Whether or not that&#8217;s true, I did realize that I&#8217;m pretty good at
finding solutions to problems from the collective experiences, wisdom, and
flames of the Internet. Maybe it&#8217;s not entirely fair to say that I faked my
way through several years of a career. After all the code that I&#8217;ve put
together over the years to answer various questions, or sift through or
collect data serves a purpose, performs relatively well, and is serving people
everyday. Also, that disgusting snippet of string highlighting code works
pretty well, despite that fact that I hate its face and want it to die.</p>

<p>After I got myself out of my existential development funk, more questions came
to mind. First, how the F did anyone get any answers to tough questions before
the Internet? Secondly, how did programmers back in the day find any sort of
direction? Books on technology and programming are great, don&#8217;t get me wrong,
but you can&#8217;t get answers to complicated questions. After having these
thoughts crop up, I spent a little bit of time looking over other devs&#8217;
shoulders at the office. What I saw was very reassuring, as the Google machine
was often hard at work for the rest of the team. The php site, StackOverflow,
and QuirksMode were in browsers constantly.</p>

<p>Which begs yet another question: what exactly does it take to be a web
programmer? Based on my experience, it seems to boil down to an Internet
connection, Google, tenacity to the point of stupidity, and decent search
skills. To back up even further, is it possible to take on a job you know
nothing about, and learn how do it via the Internet?</p>

			SXSW Isn&#8217;t for Backend Devs Anymore</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>During my time at the interactive portion of SXSW, I was looking for great
technical panels on practical ways to improve my technical skills. While I
found a bunch of panels that addressed some interesting issues, I don&#8217;t think
I saw any server side code the entire time I was there. There were a number of
great CSS and HTML5 talks, but aside from the PHP workshop that was listed at
the wrong time in the booklet, I found no practical talks for backend
developers.</p>

<p>Over the past couple years, it seems like there has definitely been a shift in
how sxsw views technical talks. Two years ago, there were developers
presenting great content on how to structure APIs, write great PHP, and
develop iPhone / Android Apps. This year, the php workshop had the incorrect
time printed in the booklet. The technical talks this year seemed be designed
for the nontechnical. The discussions around scaling included big names
quoting scaling statistics that are sure to be taken out of context and read
as homily by technical managers everywhere. The Android Developer meetup was
almost completely devoid of Android devs, just sharks looking for them, myself
included. The panel on the death of the RDBMS painted a rosy picture of what
databases could be, but did not include a mention of a single technology that
fit the presenter&#8217;s pipe dream.</p>

<p>The ubiquitousness of the term social media at SXSW leaves me with one
conclusion. SXSW has changed from a gathering that was about people doing cool
stuff to a group of people talking about stuff they think is cool right now.
There has been a lot of discussion on conversation, but not much conversation
on how to create things worth talking about.</p>

			The Progress Bar Pysch</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A classic UX problems is communicating to users how long they&#8217;ll have to wait
before their task completes. A spinner or progress bar provides feedback that
the system is, in fact, doing something, and how long that task may take.
Psychologically, progress bars create tension while progressing, and
resolution when completed.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, progress bars are black magic. The developer is
attempting to estimate a task based on potentially thousands of variables. In
the case of a file upload, the developer has to deal with differing network
conditions, disk performance, etc, etc, etc. Then they have to write the code
to communicate what is happening to the browser. Not a trivial task. However,
when executed well, can provide the user with reasonable feedback about their
task.</p>

<p>Lately, sites like LinkedIn, Mint.com, and OKCupid have used that same tension
to motivate users to completely fill out their profiles. During profile
creation, a progress bar is displayed indicating how far the user has come
along. Once the user completely fills out their profile, the progress bar hits
100%, and what changes? In most cases, nothing. The progress bar is just a
psychological hack to entice users to go through the entire process.</p>

<p>The question is: Exactly how effective is the progress bar at enticing users
to fully complete the task at hand? And are they actually worth it.</p>

			Emergencies Will Audit the Shit Out of You</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Things never go wrong at convenient times: Like when you&#8217;re auditing the
latest, coolest version of your app, and looking for bugs. Things have a funny
way of working out fine <strong>then</strong>. However, soon as you look the other way, a
multitude of problems come out of the woodwork. It usually goes something like
this:</p>

<p>One server goes down, and the system that was supposed to fail silently starts
screaming. The application it was supporting goes down, because the proper
timeouts and error handling was never written. You can&#8217;t fail over, because
failing over will take down 2 other applications. When that first server comes
back up, nothing works, because the proper startup scripts were never put in
place. Once the right services start, if you can remember what the hell they
were, you find the original application is configured wrong. Not only is it
configured wrong, it&#8217;s <strong><em>always</em></strong> been configured wrong, and no one noticed.
No one noticed because it only explodes in the exact set of horrible
circumstances you have right now. Which is, by the way, being down.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an all-too-familiar story, and one that even most the anal of admins has
dealt with. The fact of the matter is that it is going to happen, and there&#8217;s
not a whole lot you can do to prepare, other than randomly pulling plugs out
of servers. But with any mistake that causes downtime, it should <a href="http://l.chr.ishenry.com/fail">only happen
once</a>. Proper postmortem examination needs to
be taken here to figure out what went wrong where. Once all the variables are
understood, the next step is to duplicate the same set of circumstances in
your <a href="http://l.chr.ishenry.com/sbx">sandbox</a>, and apply the necessary error
handling.</p>

<p>Downtime and emergencies are a part of running any site. What&#8217;s really
important is to treat emergencies as an opportunity to learn about what
happens when systems fail, for real.</p>

		<a href="/2010/10/09/search-is-hard/">
		
			Search Is Hard</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The title of this post is a direct quote from a Facebook engineer presenting
at the SXSW panel <a href="http://my.sxsw.com/events/event/386">Beyond Lamp</a>. Search
is a critical function of any site, but its gotten much much harder as Google
has gotten better. To quote the Beyond Lamp panel one more time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Search is always compared against Google, which is like comparing the canoe
you just built to the QE2.</p></blockquote>

<p>The difficulty of search is made apparent by the majority of sites, even major
sites get it wrong. A large factor in the success of search is relevancy.
Google takes into account <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">500 million
variables</a> in determining how relevant
content is. Not only that, but they also know who you are, what you&#8217;ve
clicked, and can make decisions based on that to present pages that are more
relevant to you. Facebook&#8217;s EdgeRank, LinkedIn&#8217;s Signal are other examples of
search implementations that are vast in scale.</p>

<p>In a startup, where time is of the essence and resources need to be begged,
borrowed or stolen, search is a huge challenge. Like trying to be build the
QE2 with nothing but a swiss army knife. Basic tools normally don&#8217;t cut it.
MySQL&#8217;s FULLTEXT indexes are helpful, but start trying to implement basic IR
techniques like booleans, and MySQL&#8217;s builtin functionality starts to lack the
ability to get the results your want.</p>

<p>There are ways to simplify building search.
<a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2010/01/28/sphinx-full-text-search-engine/">Sphinx</a>
provides great matching capabilities and incredibly fast sorting. When
combined with other data, Sphinx can be a great way to get users fast,
meaningful results. The one downside with using a document based search engine
is that there is little room for returning completely tailored results. Unlike
MySQL, which allows you to slice and dice data in any way you choose, it is
more difficult to return results that take into account relationship specific
to users and documents. However, for most search tasks, it should function
very well.</p>

			It Happens to Everyone&#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Through a combination of unhealthy fears, paranoid tendencies, and luck, I&#8217;ve
been able to avoid that unavoidable situation that every sysadmin fears:
completely nuking a system. Until last Tuesday, when I did something really,
really dumb. On the server that hosts
<a href="http://chr.ishenry.com">http://chr.ishenry.com</a>, I had noticed a script,
<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=svcrack.py">svcrack.py</a>, running and consuming lots of
resources, and bandwidth, as I would later find out from my hosting bill.</p>

<p>Since I sure as hell wasn&#8217;t running that, I could only assume that someone had
exploited my server and was using it to look for unsecured voip installations.
Initially, I assumed killing the scripts and changing some passwords would be
sufficient. However, checking in the server later, I found the same script
running. All this is fair enough, as I am on Wordpress, a few versions behind,
and there are enough folders with unhealthy permissions that I kind of
deserved it. So after a few days of trying to lock things down, I got a bit
desperate.</p>

<p>Since svcrack is a python script, there was a good chance the best way to
discourage my assailant would be to remove python. Great idea in theory, but
it seemed my execution was a bit poor. It turns out running &#8216;yum remove
python&#8217; is a great way to destroy your entire system. yum runs on python,
which meant a reinstall would have to be done manually. Only problem, most of
the shell bultins stopped working as well. cp, mv, ls all resulted in a
&#8216;command not found&#8217; error. The best part of this situation: no backups. After
all the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/12/international-backup-%0Aawareness-day.html">hubbub about blogs and
backups</a> lately, it&#8217;s kind of amazing I missed this rather
important detail.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always considered data loss the cardinal sin in development, web or
otherwise. However, I also never considered my personal site to be mission
critical, or worthy of taking the the time for backups. But as they say, you
never know what you have till it&#8217;s gone. I was lucky enough that mysql and
apache were still running, and I was able to export everything, spin up a new
server, and import. Even with no data loss, this is certainly a lesson
learned. I am making a backup right now.</p>

			Ode to the Environment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Consistency is key, in everything. People come to rely on trains, because they
come on time. Devs rely on the environment which they develop in, because its
stability allows them to be productive. Changing or upgrading that environment
can be the same as changing the train schedule. Sometimes people get where
they&#8217;re going faster, but sometimes, the change makes their life miserable.</p>

<p>Environment upgrades can be just like that.  Speed, security, features.
Everybody likes those.  The ugly side to upgrades is that they have a tendency
to break things that are already working, may be incompatible with current
code, and disrupt the work of the team.  As a struggling sysadmin / developer,
all I really want in life is to build a stable platform that I can build my
app in.</p>

<p>Hence, the Ode to the Environment:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Environment is the basis for my business. Without it, and it&#8217;s
consistency, there is uncertainty, chaos, and ultimately, failure.</p></blockquote>

<p>I need to be able to replicate the Environment quickly, identify when issues
are caused by it, <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2010/02/22/sandboxes/%20">sandbox</a>
it, and be comfortable building it from scratch, if it comes to that.
(Hopefully, it never does.)</p>

<p>I need to be confident in the set of packages I&#8217;ve come to love, loathe, and
rely on, and make sure they work for my business&#8217;s app.</p>

<p>I know that the Environment&#8217;s well-being will affect my application&#8217;s uptime,
developers relying on it, and my business&#8217;s reputation.</p>

<p>I need to know the flaws and shortcomings in the Environment, and weigh how to
fix them against the cost of change.</p>

<p>When it comes time to upgrade the Environment, there will be damn good reason.
I need to be horribly convinced that my business will see benefits
immediately.</p>

<p>Once I upgrade the Environment, I need to love and loathe it same as the old,
embrace whatever change it brings, advocate for it and fix whatever issues the
change brings.</p>

<p>Above all, I will maintain the best Environment that suits my business, and
ensure that it is always meets the goals of my business, no matter the cost.</p>

			Gmail Actually Gets Something Really Wrong.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Gmail and Google Apps for
<a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2009/04/26/just-manage-it-for-me/">many</a> reasons. I
love the new redesign, and how they&#8217;re finally promoting consistency across
their major webapps. It makes me feel like the web could <em>really</em> be a viable
alternative alternative to desktop software. I can even deal with
<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/06/gmail-performance-issues.html">slowness</a> in
Gmail, given the amount of work they need to do in order to keep your inbox
snappy. They need to index every message, which means parsing every message,
converting every attachment, and linking it the search architecture. In real
time. Not easy…</p>

<p>However, what I found today, was completely inexcusable: Gmail&#8217;s clipping
&#8220;feature&#8221;. This is definitely a feature that sounds a lot more like a bug than
a helpful tool.</p>

<p><a href="/images/user/gmail_clipping.png"><img src="/images/user/gmail_clipping.png" alt="Gmail Message clipping" /></a></p>

<p>What <em>should</em> be here is a few more links, some mouse text that contains our
mailing address and unsubscribe links. What I did not show in this screenshot
is the capacity for destruction this feature has on HTML emails. When the
email is &#8216;clipped&#8217;, the HTML is broken at a random place, and not displayed.
If your message is clipped at an inopportune place, there goes your entire
HTML layout. In the best case, your HTML is simply truncated, leaving users
with only a piece of their email.</p>

<p>As the entity sending this email, the responsibility falls on me to make sure
that I send emails that are accessible, conform to CAN-SPAM, and are pleasing
to the eye. Gmail bones me on three of these goals. Thanks to a
<a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=9377">lack</a> of
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2asve9s">documentation</a> as to how long an email can be
without invoking the clipping feature. Most importantly, my users have no
clear to unsubscribe from the list, since the most likely links to be clipped
are the unsubscribe links.</p>

<p>I agree that
<a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=9377">performance</a>
is king, but never at the cost of the user.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It seems like Gmail limits messages to around 102k characters before clipping. So the solution seems to be running HTML through a compressor. I found a pretty good one <a href="http://www.textfixer.com/html/compress-html-compression.php">here</a></p>

where a table needs to accept a lot of data. InnoDB&#8217;s use of memory to store
indexes or sometimes the entire table can also make reads incredibly fast,
especially on tables that need to support complex queries where even the best
placed indexes do nothing.</p>

<p>However, when tables get large, the innodb_buffer_pool is set to close to
amount of memory on the server, Linux has a tendency to remove your data from
memory for no good reason. The symptoms are unmistakable: a query that was
known to be pretty quick, but hasn&#8217;t run in a while, will take long. Too long.
Run it again, and it becomes snappy. What&#8217;s happening is that when the query
initially runs, the necessary data isn&#8217;t in memory, so it&#8217;s read in from disk,
and the query is performed. Once it&#8217;s in memory, that second run is quick.</p>

<p>Actually there is a good reason Linux behaves like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;My point is that decreasing the tendency of the kernel to swap stuff out is
wrong. You really don&#8217;t want hundreds of megabytes of BloatyApp&#8217;s untouched
memory floating about in the machine. Get it out on the disk, use the memory
for something useful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000">[http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000](http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000)</a></li>
</ul>


<p>This all makes sense, as most systems need to reclaim memory from applications
that aren&#8217;t doing anything. Except in the case where you have a large dataset
in InnoDB that you&#8217;d really like to be in memory when you query it. Luckily,
there is a tunable that you can change to dictate how aggressive Linux is
reclaiming memory from applications. /proc/sys/vm/swappiness stores a number
for 0 to 100, where 100 means that Linux will be extremely aggressive in
reclaiming memory, and 0 means that memory won&#8217;t be reclaimed all that much.</p>

<p>For servers that need to keep datasets in memory all the time, this variable
can be extremely helpful. With an InnoDB table / indexes that consume ~80% of
memory on the machine, a swappiness value of 30 is sufficient to allow MySQL
to keep most of that in memory. Of course, I don&#8217;t recommend this for a
machine that is not 100% dedicated to a single task. However, on dedicated
MySQL machines, tuning this variable can be really helpful.</p>

			Out of the Terminal</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every once and a while I get to leave server-land and get to do some fun
projects that involve doing something on the front end. The latest was
building an embed script for the Behance <a href="http://www.behance.net/joblist">Job
List</a>. Projects like this, that get me out of
the terminal and into a space that requires a bit more interaction between
domains, are particularly appealing. As much as I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same Origin
Policy</a> is reasonable rule
for security, I love looking at ways to get around it.</p>

<p>The technique I chose for this was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#JSONP">JSONP</a>, or JSON with Padding. I&#8217;m a
huge fan of JSON as a transport, as I feel it is compact, flexible and
stupidly simple to generate and consume. In fact, I&#8217;ve sworn to never touch
another XML file as long as I live. JSONP is really convenient from a API
implementation perspective, because when the request for the data is made (via
the script tag), all the client has to do is pass a callback and it can use
the data in any way it chooses. The server doesn&#8217;t have to be aware of what
the callback actually does, although I do recommend checking against a list of
pre-approved callbacks, just to make sure.</p>

<p>Like any semi-decent developer, I have dog-fooded my own work, and implemented
the Behance Joblist embed code right <a href="/design-jobs/">here.</a></p>

<p>A little about the Behance Joblist:</p>

<blockquote><p>Top global companies find and hire talent on Behance, the world&#8217;s leading
network for creative professionals.</p></blockquote>
