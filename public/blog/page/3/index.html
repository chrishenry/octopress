	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-%0Aprogram.html">FizzBuzz</a> test is a simple way of showing that a developer has mastery of
basic concepts like loops, variables and operators. Having given the test to
other developers several times, I felt like a bit of hypocrite having never
actually having taken it myself. I&#8217;ve also asked folks to complete the task in
php, even though it wasn&#8217;t a language they were particularly familiar with.
So, I decided it was time to end the hypocrisy, and give myself a little
challenge:</p>

<p><strong>Do FizzBuzz in as many languages as I could.</strong></p>

<p>So, what did I learn?</p>

<ul>
<li>With the <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2011/06/13/development-without-internet-access/">internet</a>, you can learn the basics of most programming languages in about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Programming knowledge is portable between most common web languages. A loop is a loop, a variable is a variable, etc. Syntax for a task this simple can be learned in a few minutes.</li>
<li>FizzBuzz <em>can</em> be done in sql, bitch.</li>
<li>Clojure is hard for no reason.</li>
<li>Lisp is basically impossible to get running.</li>
<li>Languages have uptake because they&#8217;re included with the OS and have good documentation and communities.
In the end, doing FizzBuzz in 10 languages took around 5 hours. There was,
however, significant time taken for screwing around on Twitter, potty breaks,
drinking too much coffee, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13536889/php-works-but-%0Agives-sql-syntax-error/13536929#comment18536820_13536929">curmedgeon-ing on
StackOverflow,</a> drinking beer, and
making carnitas. Time was also spent looking for a way to run my FizzBuzzes in
bash and benchmark them, which proved fruitless, since OS X doesn&#8217;t support
nanoseconds in the date command.</li>
</ul>

		<a href="/2012/08/19/appnet-i-smell-a-pattern/">
		
			app.net, I Smell a Pattern</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After being pummeled into submission by 42924 tweets about
<a href="https://join.app.net/">app.net,</a> I finally decided it was time to take a look
at what seemed like a very popular concept. If (IF) I understand correctly,
app.net is an attempt to reboot Twitter. The aim is to build a realtime social
feed free from the shackles of advertising, and instead a focus on creating an
experience tailored to its users and developers. Also, there seems to be a $50
cover.</p>

<p>Frankly, this undertaking seems ill advised, as does asking a bunch of people
for $50 for a username. App.net is taking on the giants of the Internet who
have worked for years to build product, developer community, etc. Having
worked with Twitter&#8217;s APIs, I can say that Twitter has done a fantastic job of
advocating for developers and providing them the tools and data to innovate. I
can also say that I actually haven&#8217;t noticed much impact from advertising, and
I consider myself a pretty heavy Twitter user. I also tend to have a hard time
differentiating between Rob Delaney&#8217;s
<a href="https://twitter.com/Charmin/status/231413266251907073">digital</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/HomeDepot/status/235083704358301697">harassment</a> and
properly promoted tweets.</p>

<p>Looking back, this project doesn&#8217;t seem all that different from
<a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a>. A small team aggravated with certain
aspects of larger services that they love puts out an app that is viable, but
is really a carbon copy of the original, with their own special twist.
Diaspora and App.net both want their users to have control over privacy, data,
and how much advertising is shoved in their face. Currently, Diaspora seems to
be completely off the radar, having made practically no dent in addressing its
original goals.</p>

<p>Building a product to address a flaw in someone else&#8217;s product seems to be a
fools errand, particularly when the giants of real time social feeds are well
ensconced. Building a competitor product also doesn&#8217;t seem like a great way to
convince the Internet that advertising is bad. Also, the Internet doesn&#8217;t
really need convincing that ads are bad. I&#8217;m relatively sure that based on
diving click throughs, nonexistent conversion, and the mere existence of
banner blindness that Internet advertising industry also knows that its days
are numbered. Interestingly enough, the most fertile area of brand awareness
actually seems to be around using real time social media to engage in simple,
human ways. So I&#8217;m not sure how cutting brands out of the business model will
help here.</p>

<p>What surprises me most about the existence of app.net is how blatantly it
reinvents the wheel. The alpha was put out to show backers there was a real
app behind the video. However, aside from proving they can convince folks that
advertising control is bad, the actual app doesn&#8217;t really do anything
innovative or different, at least that I can see. OK, you got me, there&#8217;s
[data export|http://daltoncaldwell.com/we-did-it]. Realistically, this is an
alpha, there&#8217;s virtually no data to export, so I would hardly consider this a
marvel of engineering. When Diaspora came onto the scene, they had actually
built something different, and innovative. Even Identi.ca attempted to
<a href="http://identi.ca/doc/faq">differentiate themselves</a> in functionality.</p>

<p>This entire project reeks of misdirected energy, and a &#8221;<a href="http://www.richard-banks.org/2007/07/built-here-syndrome.html">not built
here</a>&#8221;
mentality. Granted, I&#8217;m a huge fan of building things that make you happy,
it&#8217;s part of what keeps me going as a developer. Truthfully, the thing I love
most about being a developer is that I can build whatever the fuck I want,
whether it helps, hurts, solves a problem, or complicates stuff. However, I
just can&#8217;t help but feel this entire project is a form of lashing out. It
feels destructive to me to rally a group of smart people off of a platform
that&#8217;s working well because of some flaws. Flaws which are really inherent
challenges building business on the Internet. I feel like a more effective
method of changing the environment would&#8217;ve been creating better ways to
monetize without having to resort to advertising.</p>

			MySQL&#8217;s INSERT SELECT, Replication, and You</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Whenever there are situations where data needs to be copied from table to
table, or SELECTing lots of rows to be inserted, the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert-select.html">INSERT
SELECT</a> is an
elegant solution. It reduces the number of queries sent to a MySQL server, and
makes for elegant code. Additionally, with INSERT SELECTs, all processing
happens on the MySQL side. The app doesn&#8217;t have to deal with having any of the
data in memory. This means that application servers can be run with less
memory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, INSERT SELECT&#8217;s best use cases coincide with cases where the
SELECT query has the potential to run a long time. On standalone servers
running InnoDB, this can be fine, as reads and writes will continue to execute
concurrently. However, if you&#8217;re running MyISAM, queries will lock, and
nothing will execute. Instead, queries will queue up, your application will
come to a dead halt, MySQL will likely hit max_connections and Very Bad Things
will happen.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-%0Aimplementation.html">replicated</a> environments, even well tuned ones running on InnoDB, a
long running INSERT SELECT can cause other sorts of problem. MySQL replication
is statement based. In other words, every statement that writes to disk on the
master is written to a log. The log is then transferred to slave(s), and those
statements are replayed on the slaves.</p>

<p>With INSERT SELECTS, every slave needs to run the same SELECT. The master will
not simply pass on the results of the SELECT, but rather simply pass the same
query to be executed by the slave(s). So in a replicated environment, it&#8217;s
even more important to keep an eye on how long those INSERT SELECTS are
running. Not only is it a waste of processing power to run the SELECT portion
of the query across the entire cluster, the SELECT will actually block other
statements in the log from executing. This means that the data on the slaves
will become out of sync with the master, a condition called slave lag.</p>

<p>INSERT SELECT is a great tool, but beware of the costs of using it in certain
situations.</p>

			Gallow Green Is Still a bit&#8230;green</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since seeing <a href="http://www.sleepnomore.com/">Sleep No More</a> a year ago, I&#8217;ve
been a huge fan of the rich, immersive experience put together by
<a href="http://www.punchdrunk.org.uk/">Punchdrunk</a>.  I loved the dreamy feeling of
walking through an entire other world, inhabited by scared, angry, jealous
shadows running, fighting and going insane. The Manderley bar, within the
hotel, was an amazing experience, no less detailed than the rest of the hotel.
The absinthe punch, in particular, is a fantastic drink, dark and complex,
that perfectly compliments the experience.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that they were opening a rooftop bar at the McKittrick Hotel
called <a href="http://www.mckittrickhotel.com/gallowgreen/">Gallow Green</a>, I
instantly bought tickets and eagerly awaited the night. The entrance was
similar to that of Sleep No More. After a short wait, you&#8217;re ushered into a
small elevator that opens into a open floor with a coat check and a set of
stairs to the roof. The rooftop garden is spacious, romantically lit, and
beautifully decorated. Somehow or other, they also managed to get old rail car
up there, too.</p>

<p>My night at Gallow Green didn&#8217;t quite have the same magic as my previous
visits to the McKittrick. While I did not try any of the punches, the
cocktails were disappointing. The Third Degree, a gin cocktail, tasted so
strongly of warm Tanqueray that it was close to undrinkable. The Pimms Other
Cup, a murky mixture of Pimms, dark rum, lemonade and a cucumber slice was
potable, but only as a result of the lemonade. I&#8217;m not sure if this was the
result of a bartender having an off night, or that the cocktails are just
poorly conceived.</p>

<p>While the space was beautiful, it seems the night I was there, a private party
had booked an event. My wait at the door was plagued by demands of a very
entitled gentlemen, who claimed he was very important to the party. After
getting cocktails, we sat down at a table marked reserved, assuming our
reservation entitled us to a &#8216;Reserved&#8217; table. A waitress, after asking if we
were part of the party, shooed us after a few minutes, leaving Jessica and I
scurrying to find a place to sit. Luckily, we found a somewhat hidden swing a
few steps away from the bar, which we camped out on all night.</p>

<p>While the right elements are there for Gallow Green to be a fantastic
experience, my night did not reflect that. However, I&#8217;m likely to go back,
given the incredible quality of everything else in the hotel. Hopefully, my
next reservation at the McKittrick will occur on a better night.</p>

			The Argument for Generalists in Web Development</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows
absolutely everything about nothing&#8221;
-<a href="https://twitter.com/mastersje/status/192257585745891330">@mastersje</a></p>

<p>My grandfather was a carpenter. He had an immense workbench, with a pegboard
that had hundreds of hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, saws, drills, planes,
awls. They were powered, hand powered, circular, rotary and reciprocating.
Each of them had their own beauty, and their own use. The man could build a
picture frame, a desk, a dock, or an entire house. He may not have wielded any
of them expertly, but he knew which one to use when the situation called, and
he certainly knew how to use them in concert.</p>

<p>Two generations later, I have become a web developer, and can&#8217;t help but
notice the similarities between the two. He worked in wood, but I work in bits
and bytes. Web sites, especially big ones, are not the product of a single
technology, but the result of many technologies seamlessly interacting.
Building a house is no different. Framing, roofing, laying foundation are all
separate skills that require vastly different tools. Part of the challenge of
being a web developer is being able to manage lots of technologies at once.</p>

<p>Great web developers are carpenters. Just like carpentry, there is always the
right tool for the job. Infrastructure that doesn&#8217;t play well with software is
bound for failure. Software that doesn&#8217;t use or fit the hardware / kernel / OS
well won&#8217;t run well. As experts in web development, we can know less about
each technology, but should know more about how they work together. Tailoring
software or combinations of software packages is the magic bullet that solves
problems quickly and scalably.</p>

<p>In the context of early stage startups, generalists are a better bet for
getting a production up and running. Even as a team grows, having generalists
around means you can task a single developer with developing and entire
feature. With a bit of support from specialists, they can pull off shipping a
feature faster than a team of a couple of specialists. When widespread  issues
occur, I prefer to have a generalist in my corner, because they typically
understand the the connective tissue of a website very well, and are willing
to put in the time debugging from a variety of perspectives.</p>

<p>None of this is to say that specialists don&#8217;t have their place in web
development. The web is an innovative medium that it has spawned dozens of
technologies (node.js) that require a deep pool of expertise to work in. There
are vast arrays of techniques and frameworks that cater to working in a single
technology. Generalists typically won&#8217;t have the depth necessary to pull off a
awe-inspiring, truly nasty implementation. However, they&#8217;ll have the right
instincts to pair it, deploy, and make it do something meaningful that a
specialist might not be able to do by themselves.</p>

			Try Adding Distance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Part of my New Years (non-whiny) resolution was to go the gym more often. It
is a resolution that I have (mostly) adhered to over the past six months. When
I go to the gym, I <a href="http://www.fatcuda.com/wp-%0Acontent/uploads/2012/06/concept-2-model-d-rowing-machine_10_0.jpg">row</a>. I love the
rhythm, the fight against the machine, and the fact that no else at most gyms
know what to do with it. Rowing is a grueling workout, which is one of the
reasons I like it. Even when the workout is bad, it&#8217;s good. It also gives me a
chance to crawl inside myself for 20 or so minutes and muddle through the
tumult in my head.</p>

<p>For a couple weeks I kept my workout distance consistent at 4k, and was able
to drop the time almost every workout. When I added 1k meters to my workout,
the distance completely outstripped my ability to improve. When rowing the 4k,
I was able to row every
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_rower#Exercise">split</a> evenly, with very
little variance in performance. I was even able to throw in some intervals
rowing at way above my normal split, just for funsies.  But when rowing the
5k, my splits varied widely, arced, and crashed for a few months.</p>

<p>Measurement on an ergometer is pretty easy. The average split time is recorded
and displayed at the end (if you can still see through the sweat.) Also, for
every 500m you row, there&#8217;s a split and strokes/minute displayed. Essentially,
it tells you how hard you went out, at what point in your workout you died,
where you rallied, and if you pushed hard at the end. There are no lies,
deception, or excuses on the LCD, only numbers. My takeaway from this screen
is always that I was not consistent enough.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen parallels in my own life and career performance as well. While
working on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/opensocialInst%0Aallation/preview?_ch_panel_id=1&amp;_applicationId=104096">Creative Portfolio Display</a>, an extremely intense,
but relatively short duration project, I was able to push hard, crash, and
push hard again. The entire project was feature complete in approx 3 weeks.
While handling the ever growing DBA responsibilities of be.net, I&#8217;ve had an
extremely difficult time being consistent with a task that requires constant
work over years. Performance there has been inconsistent as the data outgrew
it&#8217;s architecture.</p>

<p>In personalities and friendships, I&#8217;ve come to value the people that remain
consistent over time. People who continue to struggle by doing meaningful work
that is of constant quality over years and years. Intensity is often hailed as
the more desirable between consistency and intensity. But the people who have
been the most valuable in my life and career are those who have stood beside
me for years.</p>

<p>In the end, it is the miles that make champions.</p>

			Calliope NYC</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On the corner of East 4th Street, the newest of the New American restaurants,
<a href="http://calliopenyc.com/">Calliope</a> has soft launched. It&#8217;s in a beautiful
space in a great part of the East Village. The dining room is open and airy,
thanks to being on the corner, and there being windows 2 of 4 sides of the
room. At one of the space is a georgous curved blonde wood bar. There is more
comfortable than usual outdoor seating.</p>

<p>Even before launch. they have already aquired a liquor license, but do not
have a cocktail list. The bar is suprisingly well stocked with a number of
classic European tipples; Pimms and campari were featured. The old-fashioned
left a bit to be desired, but the bartender made a decent manhattan.</p>

<p>The food was mostly well-executed. I had a slow cooked rabbit Pappardelle with
Fava beans.  It seems like they&#8217;re still tweaking the menu, as the dish was
listed as having peas in place of the Fava beans. The roast chicken with
carrots and cabbage was also stellar. The skin was crispy, well seasoned, the
carrots were the perfect texture, and the chicken stuffed cabbage lent some
color.</p>

<p>Once the staff settles in, and the menu is finalized, Calliope is going to be
a great addition to and already incredible neighborhood.</p>

			Workflow With Synergy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a web developer working in lots of different areas, I have to use <a href="http://blog.behance.net/dev/developers-toolkit-chris-%0Ahenry">lots of
different programs</a> to perform various tasks. Terminal for SSH, Eclipse for php, etc.
Chrome for all things web browsing, including Gmail. Eventually, the number of
tabs I needed to keep open during the day caused my gmail tabs to get lost
pretty easily, even after using the pin feature. Then I stumbled upon
<a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/new_index">Mailplane</a>. Mailplane is a stellar program
that turns gmail into a desktop app.</p>

<p>After adding yet another app to my stable, it seemed necessary to divide my
screen real estate into spaces. Part of the problem of having so many
different programs is the problem of context. Once situating the necessary
programs in a way that makes sense for the particular task, changing context
can completely knock me out of my flow. For a period of time, it didn&#8217;t even
make sense to use Mailplane, as it was easier to actually switch over to my
phone, and read / respond to email there.</p>

<p>Then it hit, why not just bring in my laptop, and deal with email there. So I
started bringing my laptop. This was awesome, as it allowed me to deal with
email on relatively normal sized screen and keyboard. The next issue was
dealing with links in emails. After asking the twitterverse and stackexchange,
I finally settled on <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/">Synergy</a>. Synergy allows you
to seamless share your keyboard and mouse between any number of machines. So I
started running Mailplane in fullscreen mode on a laptop situated next to my
desktop. To get to my email, I just mouse all the way to the left, and voila,
I can use a full keyboard / mouse with a laptop. If I need to open links on
the big screens, I just copy and use Chrome&#8217;s paste &amp; go feature.</p>

<p>This works tremendously well, as I can leave any development task as is on my
desktop without having to worry about shuffling things around. It also helps
tremendously when applying pesky software updates, as you always have one
machine that will be up and running.</p>

			Why SOPA Is Fucking Stupid</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At its core, SOPA represents a universal, base desire of men to protect what
they own. To some degree, it&#8217;s valid, something that anyone can respect.
However, as with most things, ideas mean precisely shite, and execution is
what really matters. In the case of SOPA, a misguided, poorly informed
government is attempting to execute an idea in a way that could do the most
damage possible. Let me count the ways SOPA is fucking stupid.</p>

<p>SOPA threatens free speech. <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2011/12/28%0A/morning-bell-the-unintended-consequences-of-internet-regulation/">This</a>
<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111228/10302017214/heritage-%0Afoundation-says-sopa-threatens-free-speech.shtml">has</a>
<a href="http://blogpatriot2.blogspot.com/2011/12/sopa-threatens-free-speech-%0Aand.html">been</a> <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">said</a> by many folks who are much
smarter than I. Any bill that allows the silencing of voices should not see
the light of day. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

<p>SOPA will starve and fracture an industry. A measure that could be taken
against an &#8220;infringing&#8221; site is forcing advertising networks to stop serving
ads for said site. For many sites, <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Eci%0AFAUHzQJA/THfX4ogb1PI/AAAAAAAAApw/_8E_nAGoUa0/s1600/madmen.png">advertising</a> is their meat
and potatoes. An equally despicable measure is forcing payment services (can
you say paypal?) to stop accepting <a href="https://www.google.com/searc%0Ah?q=e+commerce+growth&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-Q%0ALT9myEYXr0gGX6v3wBQ&amp;ved=0CHoQsAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805#hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=meat+a%0And+potatoes&amp;oq=meat+and+potatoes&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g4g-m1g-S5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=29636%0Al29636l0l29989l1l1l0l0l0l0l155l155l0.1l1l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=67%0A6c4a75e36741e5&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805">transactions</a> from the infringing site. Any site that
relies on e-commerce is now <a href="http://www.hotflick.net/flicks/200%0A0_Snatch./000SNC_Stephen_Graham_010.jpg">proper fucked</a>. Any service that provides a payment
gateway or ad services is now unreliable. There will be a rift between
providers that cooperate with SOPA, and those that don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>SOPA will break the one thing that makes the Internet accessible to humans,
DNS. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> is the system
whereby domains names are translated to network addresses. Assigning IP
addresses easy-to-remember names is one of the reasons the Internet has become
a viable medium. As an extreme measure, SOPA will alter a site&#8217;s DNS records
to point somewhere else. This last measure make is pretty clear the authors of
these bills are complete <a href="http://themalephabet.files.wordpress.com/2%0A009/06/dipshit-11.jpg?w=450">dipshits</a>.</p>

<p>While altering DNS will render the site inaccessible to most, it does not
remove the existence or accessibility of content from the Internet. This very
post is available <a href="http://174.143.169.75/2012/01/12/why-sopa-is-fucking-%0Astupid/">here</a>, whether DNS is up or not. To cope with a broken DNS system, the
Internet will respond, and it will not be pleasant. Hardware vendors will ship
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file">host files</a>) set up to protect
their own interests. Rogue DNS resolvers will pop up. The Internet will turn
into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome">Bartertown</a>.
Two browsers will enter, neither will find Facebook.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=e+commerce+growth&amp;hl=e%0An&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-QLT9myEYXr0gGX6v3wBQ&amp;ved=0C%0AHoQsAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805#hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=US+internet+industry+growth&amp;pbx=%0A1&amp;oq=US+internet+industry+growth&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=72732l82019l0l8%0A2314l26l23l3l1l1l7l234l3216l2.10.7l19l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=676c4%0Aa75e36741e5&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805">internet industry</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q%0A=e+commerce+growth&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-QLT9%0AmyEYXr0gGX6v3wBQ&amp;ved=0CHoQsAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805">e-commerce</a> have proved to be the
country&#8217;s highest growth sectors in the past few years. One of the main
contributors to that growth has been the availability of honest, reasonably
reliable, interconnected services. They&#8217;ve given the classic <a href="http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey.tumblr.com/">humble
entrepreneur + code monkey</a> team
the tools to build a business that yields riches. Compromise those tools, and
you will destroy an industry, not to mention perhaps the last golden vestige
of American opportunity. Creating a market-based system to punish violators
will only destroy the system. To help combat SOPA, contact your local
<a href="http://americancensorship.org/">congressperson</a>, or go here. To read the
