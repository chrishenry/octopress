			The Argument for Generalists in Web Development</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows
absolutely everything about nothing&#8221;
-<a href="https://twitter.com/mastersje/status/192257585745891330">@mastersje</a></p>

<p>My grandfather was a carpenter. He had an immense workbench, with a pegboard
that had hundreds of hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, saws, drills, planes,
awls. They were powered, hand powered, circular, rotary and reciprocating.
Each of them had their own beauty, and their own use. The man could build a
picture frame, a desk, a dock, or an entire house. He may not have wielded any
of them expertly, but he knew which one to use when the situation called, and
he certainly knew how to use them in concert.</p>

<p>Two generations later, I have become a web developer, and can&#8217;t help but
notice the similarities between the two. He worked in wood, but I work in bits
and bytes. Web sites, especially big ones, are not the product of a single
technology, but the result of many technologies seamlessly interacting.
Building a house is no different. Framing, roofing, laying foundation are all
separate skills that require vastly different tools. Part of the challenge of
being a web developer is being able to manage lots of technologies at once.</p>

<p>Great web developers are carpenters. Just like carpentry, there is always the
right tool for the job. Infrastructure that doesn&#8217;t play well with software is
bound for failure. Software that doesn&#8217;t use or fit the hardware / kernel / OS
well won&#8217;t run well. As experts in web development, we can know less about
each technology, but should know more about how they work together. Tailoring
software or combinations of software packages is the magic bullet that solves
problems quickly and scalably.</p>

<p>In the context of early stage startups, generalists are a better bet for
getting a production up and running. Even as a team grows, having generalists
around means you can task a single developer with developing and entire
feature. With a bit of support from specialists, they can pull off shipping a
feature faster than a team of a couple of specialists. When widespread  issues
occur, I prefer to have a generalist in my corner, because they typically
understand the the connective tissue of a website very well, and are willing
to put in the time debugging from a variety of perspectives.</p>

<p>None of this is to say that specialists don&#8217;t have their place in web
development. The web is an innovative medium that it has spawned dozens of
technologies (node.js) that require a deep pool of expertise to work in. There
are vast arrays of techniques and frameworks that cater to working in a single
technology. Generalists typically won&#8217;t have the depth necessary to pull off a
awe-inspiring, truly nasty implementation. However, they&#8217;ll have the right
instincts to pair it, deploy, and make it do something meaningful that a
specialist might not be able to do by themselves.</p>

			Try Adding Distance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Part of my New Years (non-whiny) resolution was to go the gym more often. It
is a resolution that I have (mostly) adhered to over the past six months. When
I go to the gym, I <a href="http://www.fatcuda.com/wp-%0Acontent/uploads/2012/06/concept-2-model-d-rowing-machine_10_0.jpg">row</a>. I love the
rhythm, the fight against the machine, and the fact that no else at most gyms
know what to do with it. Rowing is a grueling workout, which is one of the
reasons I like it. Even when the workout is bad, it&#8217;s good. It also gives me a
chance to crawl inside myself for 20 or so minutes and muddle through the
tumult in my head.</p>

<p>For a couple weeks I kept my workout distance consistent at 4k, and was able
to drop the time almost every workout. When I added 1k meters to my workout,
the distance completely outstripped my ability to improve. When rowing the 4k,
I was able to row every
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_rower#Exercise">split</a> evenly, with very
little variance in performance. I was even able to throw in some intervals
rowing at way above my normal split, just for funsies.  But when rowing the
5k, my splits varied widely, arced, and crashed for a few months.</p>

<p>Measurement on an ergometer is pretty easy. The average split time is recorded
and displayed at the end (if you can still see through the sweat.) Also, for
every 500m you row, there&#8217;s a split and strokes/minute displayed. Essentially,
it tells you how hard you went out, at what point in your workout you died,
where you rallied, and if you pushed hard at the end. There are no lies,
deception, or excuses on the LCD, only numbers. My takeaway from this screen
is always that I was not consistent enough.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen parallels in my own life and career performance as well. While
working on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/opensocialInst%0Aallation/preview?_ch_panel_id=1&amp;_applicationId=104096">Creative Portfolio Display</a>, an extremely intense,
but relatively short duration project, I was able to push hard, crash, and
push hard again. The entire project was feature complete in approx 3 weeks.
While handling the ever growing DBA responsibilities of be.net, I&#8217;ve had an
extremely difficult time being consistent with a task that requires constant
work over years. Performance there has been inconsistent as the data outgrew
it&#8217;s architecture.</p>

<p>In personalities and friendships, I&#8217;ve come to value the people that remain
consistent over time. People who continue to struggle by doing meaningful work
that is of constant quality over years and years. Intensity is often hailed as
the more desirable between consistency and intensity. But the people who have
been the most valuable in my life and career are those who have stood beside
me for years.</p>

<p>In the end, it is the miles that make champions.</p>

			Calliope NYC</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On the corner of East 4th Street, the newest of the New American restaurants,
<a href="http://calliopenyc.com/">Calliope</a> has soft launched. It&#8217;s in a beautiful
space in a great part of the East Village. The dining room is open and airy,
thanks to being on the corner, and there being windows 2 of 4 sides of the
room. At one of the space is a georgous curved blonde wood bar. There is more
comfortable than usual outdoor seating.</p>

<p>Even before launch. they have already aquired a liquor license, but do not
have a cocktail list. The bar is suprisingly well stocked with a number of
classic European tipples; Pimms and campari were featured. The old-fashioned
left a bit to be desired, but the bartender made a decent manhattan.</p>

<p>The food was mostly well-executed. I had a slow cooked rabbit Pappardelle with
Fava beans.  It seems like they&#8217;re still tweaking the menu, as the dish was
listed as having peas in place of the Fava beans. The roast chicken with
carrots and cabbage was also stellar. The skin was crispy, well seasoned, the
carrots were the perfect texture, and the chicken stuffed cabbage lent some
color.</p>

<p>Once the staff settles in, and the menu is finalized, Calliope is going to be
a great addition to and already incredible neighborhood.</p>

			Workflow With Synergy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a web developer working in lots of different areas, I have to use <a href="http://blog.behance.net/dev/developers-toolkit-chris-%0Ahenry">lots of
different programs</a> to perform various tasks. Terminal for SSH, Eclipse for php, etc.
Chrome for all things web browsing, including Gmail. Eventually, the number of
tabs I needed to keep open during the day caused my gmail tabs to get lost
pretty easily, even after using the pin feature. Then I stumbled upon
<a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/new_index">Mailplane</a>. Mailplane is a stellar program
that turns gmail into a desktop app.</p>

<p>After adding yet another app to my stable, it seemed necessary to divide my
screen real estate into spaces. Part of the problem of having so many
different programs is the problem of context. Once situating the necessary
programs in a way that makes sense for the particular task, changing context
can completely knock me out of my flow. For a period of time, it didn&#8217;t even
make sense to use Mailplane, as it was easier to actually switch over to my
phone, and read / respond to email there.</p>

<p>Then it hit, why not just bring in my laptop, and deal with email there. So I
started bringing my laptop. This was awesome, as it allowed me to deal with
email on relatively normal sized screen and keyboard. The next issue was
dealing with links in emails. After asking the twitterverse and stackexchange,
I finally settled on <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/">Synergy</a>. Synergy allows you
to seamless share your keyboard and mouse between any number of machines. So I
started running Mailplane in fullscreen mode on a laptop situated next to my
desktop. To get to my email, I just mouse all the way to the left, and voila,
I can use a full keyboard / mouse with a laptop. If I need to open links on
the big screens, I just copy and use Chrome&#8217;s paste &amp; go feature.</p>

<p>This works tremendously well, as I can leave any development task as is on my
desktop without having to worry about shuffling things around. It also helps
tremendously when applying pesky software updates, as you always have one
machine that will be up and running.</p>

		<a href="/2012/01/12/why-sopa-is-fucking-stupid/">
		
			Why SOPA Is Fucking Stupid</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At its core, SOPA represents a universal, base desire of men to protect what
they own. To some degree, it&#8217;s valid, something that anyone can respect.
However, as with most things, ideas mean precisely shite, and execution is
what really matters. In the case of SOPA, a misguided, poorly informed
government is attempting to execute an idea in a way that could do the most
damage possible. Let me count the ways SOPA is fucking stupid.</p>

<p>SOPA threatens free speech. <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2011/12/28%0A/morning-bell-the-unintended-consequences-of-internet-regulation/">This</a>
<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111228/10302017214/heritage-%0Afoundation-says-sopa-threatens-free-speech.shtml">has</a>
<a href="http://blogpatriot2.blogspot.com/2011/12/sopa-threatens-free-speech-%0Aand.html">been</a> <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">said</a> by many folks who are much
smarter than I. Any bill that allows the silencing of voices should not see
the light of day. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

<p>SOPA will starve and fracture an industry. A measure that could be taken
against an &#8220;infringing&#8221; site is forcing advertising networks to stop serving
ads for said site. For many sites, <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Eci%0AFAUHzQJA/THfX4ogb1PI/AAAAAAAAApw/_8E_nAGoUa0/s1600/madmen.png">advertising</a> is their meat
and potatoes. An equally despicable measure is forcing payment services (can
you say paypal?) to stop accepting <a href="https://www.google.com/searc%0Ah?q=e+commerce+growth&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-Q%0ALT9myEYXr0gGX6v3wBQ&amp;ved=0CHoQsAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805#hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=meat+a%0And+potatoes&amp;oq=meat+and+potatoes&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g4g-m1g-S5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=29636%0Al29636l0l29989l1l1l0l0l0l0l155l155l0.1l1l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=67%0A6c4a75e36741e5&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805">transactions</a> from the infringing site. Any site that
relies on e-commerce is now <a href="http://www.hotflick.net/flicks/200%0A0_Snatch./000SNC_Stephen_Graham_010.jpg">proper fucked</a>. Any service that provides a payment
gateway or ad services is now unreliable. There will be a rift between
providers that cooperate with SOPA, and those that don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>SOPA will break the one thing that makes the Internet accessible to humans,
DNS. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> is the system
whereby domains names are translated to network addresses. Assigning IP
addresses easy-to-remember names is one of the reasons the Internet has become
a viable medium. As an extreme measure, SOPA will alter a site&#8217;s DNS records
to point somewhere else. This last measure make is pretty clear the authors of
these bills are complete <a href="http://themalephabet.files.wordpress.com/2%0A009/06/dipshit-11.jpg?w=450">dipshits</a>.</p>

<p>While altering DNS will render the site inaccessible to most, it does not
remove the existence or accessibility of content from the Internet. This very
post is available <a href="http://174.143.169.75/2012/01/12/why-sopa-is-fucking-%0Astupid/">here</a>, whether DNS is up or not. To cope with a broken DNS system, the
Internet will respond, and it will not be pleasant. Hardware vendors will ship
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file">host files</a>) set up to protect
their own interests. Rogue DNS resolvers will pop up. The Internet will turn
into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome">Bartertown</a>.
Two browsers will enter, neither will find Facebook.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=e+commerce+growth&amp;hl=e%0An&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-QLT9myEYXr0gGX6v3wBQ&amp;ved=0C%0AHoQsAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805#hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=US+internet+industry+growth&amp;pbx=%0A1&amp;oq=US+internet+industry+growth&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=72732l82019l0l8%0A2314l26l23l3l1l1l7l234l3216l2.10.7l19l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=676c4%0Aa75e36741e5&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805">internet industry</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q%0A=e+commerce+growth&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-QLT9%0AmyEYXr0gGX6v3wBQ&amp;ved=0CHoQsAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=805">e-commerce</a> have proved to be the
country&#8217;s highest growth sectors in the past few years. One of the main
contributors to that growth has been the availability of honest, reasonably
reliable, interconnected services. They&#8217;ve given the classic <a href="http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey.tumblr.com/">humble
entrepreneur + code monkey</a> team
the tools to build a business that yields riches. Compromise those tools, and
you will destroy an industry, not to mention perhaps the last golden vestige
of American opportunity. Creating a market-based system to punish violators
will only destroy the system. To help combat SOPA, contact your local
<a href="http://americancensorship.org/">congressperson</a>, or go here. To read the

			New Years Actionable (Non-whiner) Resolutions</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Normally, I&#8217;ve considered New Year&#8217;s Resolutions to be for whiners, people who
never actually accomplish anything, people who are normally on the
whhhaaaambulance. Most resolutions fall somewhere in the &#8220;stop being fat&#8221; to
&#8220;be fluent in mesopotamian glyphs&#8221; range. They&#8217;re vague, completely un-
actionable, and just describe a slightly unattainable goal / end result /
dumbass want. This year, however, I&#8217;ve discovered a few serious problems in my
life I need to fix. So, in the spirit of actually doing shit, I&#8217;ve provided a
list of non-whiner resolutions + ways to actually make them happen.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Go to bed early(ish)</strong>. This is a tough one for me. I&#8217;m naturally a night
owl, but I might be able to fool myself to getting to bed early by showering
early(ish). I love me a good shower. I&#8217;ve even been known to drink a beer in
the shower. I also really like being in really warm, comfortable, if slightly
embarrassing, PJs. All these things put me in a good mood and generally make
me want to relax, which is not all that far from being asleep. Action Steps:
Just get in the fucking shower, don&#8217;t look at the mail / email / dirty dishes
/ messy apartment / email / Twitter, just get in the shower (bring a beer).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>See some doctors</strong>. I&#8217;ve avoided doctors for awhile, mostly because my
lifestyle is a cross between Denis Nedry from Jurassic Park and a barfly. I
consider this pretty simple. Action Steps: Make appointments with the
following: dentist, general physician, eye doctor, nutritionist. Do it. Do
what they say, even if it sucks. Follow up as often as the quacks say so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Go to the gym regularly</strong>. OK, this one is, without a doubt, the most
cliche, whine-tastic resolution evar. I know, because I have been to the gym
in January. I&#8217;ve also been to the gym in April, when all the kids who were at
the gym in January are nowhere to be found. Also, since the gym is a #creepy
and #gross place to shower, resolution #1 should be even more important.
Action Steps: Put that ish on the Google calendar with the following
reminders; 2 hours, 1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes
before. Keep gym clothes in the office. Don&#8217;t care how bad they smell.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blog more</strong>. Writing has been a great way to get me to collect my
thoughts, find some hindsight, and maybe, just maybe, help some other folks
who have the same demented thoughts / stupid problems. As a technical guy,
&#8220;the inspiration&#8221; doesn&#8217;t hit me so often, and when it does, I&#8217;m often busy,
y&#8217;know, actually doing shit. However, as I&#8217;ve noted to myself more than once,
keeping track of my day and journaling how I spend my time is something
incredibly important for introspection. Action Steps: Write that thought down.
Write down what you did 30 seconds ago, especially if it was different from
regularly scheduled programming. Keep a sticky on your monitor to write shite
down. Ask the dude next to you (<a href="http://twitter.com/bossjones">@bossjones</a>) to
remind you to you write shit down. Lastly, a glass (or 7) of white wine, the
notebook in which all your shit is written, and wordpress should convene
regularly. Google Calendar #ftw, again. Lastly, check Google Analytics on
posts. The un-monitored blog post is not worth writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read more</strong>. Once upon a time (yesterday) I didn&#8217;t know nearly as much as
I do now. Most of that knowledge came from reading shit-tons of blogs, books,
bathroom graffiti, articles, and whitepapers related to web development. I
read everything with a goal: How can I use, or leverage this to help me / my
business work a little better? The Action Steps here are a bit tougher, and
slightly conflict with non-whiner resolution #6: Keep Google Reader open.
Curate my list of feeds with relevant sources. Prune feeds that stopped

			Why I Hate Sushi Restaurants</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sushi restaurants hold a special place in my heart as possibly the worst place
to go for a meal. Granted, I have not been to many, but the ones I have been
to all share the same horrible characteristics.</p>

<p>The service is always has a certain briskness to it. To many, this is great,
you order, get your food, eat, and have your plates taken away almost as the
last piece of sashimi leaves your chopsticks. Rice notwithstanding, once most
of your food is gone, so is your plate, replaced almost as quickly with the
check. While many consider speed to be a feature, I&#8217;m not sure I agree when it
comes to my dinner. While the staff at every sushi joint I&#8217;ve ever been to has
been efficient, they&#8217;ve also been less than accommodating when it comes to
simple things, like recommendations.</p>

<p>Ambiance and fellow patrons normally leave something to be desired as well.
Somehow, sushi has come to be the meal of choice for the screaming hordes of
clubgoers, Jersey Shore wannabes, and that certain type douchebag that only
comes at night. Thusly, the soundtrack of most of these places closely
resembles being inside a speaker cabinet while DJ Pauly D spins whatever the
fuck it is that he spins. Again, nothing wrong with that, but not while
consuming raw fish.</p>

<p>Then, there&#8217;s sushi itself. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like sushi, particularly a
real nice piece of toro when it&#8217;s nice and cold. And I&#8217;ve been adventurous
enough to have tried some more exotic options, like uni, which is without a
doubt, a taste you need to acquire. I also understand that it&#8217;s considered an
art form. But what bothers me most about going out for sushi is the vast
majority of places do not regard it that way.</p>

			MySQL Error 28</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday, I had to run a query for some statistics I needed. This was a query
that I knew were going to be particularly nasty as it required sorting 1.3M
rows. Normally I run these sorts of queries on a reporting slave I keep around
for this reason, but for some reason I chose to run this query on a production
slave. When I ran my query, I got the following error;</p>

<p>ERROR 3 (HY000): Error writing file &#8216;/tmp/MYNcSyQ9&#8217; (Errcode: 28)</p>

<p>Oh. *&amp;<sup>%.</sup> After some Googling, a bit of shitting my pants, and a wild grep
session through as many application logs as I could find, I was able to figure
out that problem seemed limited to this particular query. My Googling turned
up the fact that the error code indicated that the server was out of disk
space.</p>

<p>As a rapidly growing company, we&#8217;ve had our fair share of issues with managing
(or failing to manage) rapidly filling disks, failed RAID controllers, and the
like. However, I had recently done audits of this particular cluster of
servers, and ascertained that the situation with disks was nominal. I was
confident the disk wasn&#8217;t full, and permissions were correct. Our particular
disk layout puts /tmp on its own 2GB partition, and after running the query,
that partition was 2% full.</p>

<p>It turns out that during the execution of the query, MySQL was creating a
temporary table that was 2GB, hence the error. By default MySQL will write
temporary tables to /tmp, which in many cases, is its own small partition. The
solution here was to set the tmpdir to a folder on the main partition adjacent
to the MySQL datadir. This solution obviously has its own problems (ie you
could fill your main partition, which is way worse than filling /tmp) However,
for this type of ad hoc query, this was exactly what we needed.</p>

			Three Tough Projects and Bands That Got Me Through Them</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Creative Index</p>

<p>The now defunct Creative Index was a search engine aimed at indexing portfolio
sites. The Creative Index was perhaps the most open-ended project I have ever
taken on. The goal was to allow people to list their various portfolio sites,
have the Creative Index scrape their sites, index all the textual content, and
make it searchable via a Google-like interface. Of course, the project was
doomed from the beginning, as results would be measured against Google, and we
all know how that goes. I had never taken on a project that required taking
such unstructured data, also another reason it was doomed. Most portfolio
sites contain very little text, which makes matching and ranking difficult.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s when I discovered the <a href="http://www.themarsvolta.com/">Mars Volta</a>.
While writing the engine to handle the retrieval of web pages, I learned just
how chaotic the underbelly of Internet is. Circular redirects, 404s, bad
links, authenticated pages made my code check hundreds of variables in the
most paranoid, chaotic way possible. The Mars Volta&#8217;s drug-induced,
hallucination-inspired free-form rock-jazz-samba was a great soundtrack to the
chaos I was trying to make sense of.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/opensocialInstallation/pr%0Aeview?_ch_panel_id=1&amp;_applicationId=104096">Creative Portfolio Display</a></p>

<p>In July of 2010, I had the distinct honor of developing one of the few InApps
for Linkedin. LinkedIn&#8217;s InApp platform runs on Google OpenSocial. OpenSocial
is a great way to plug in 3rd party apps in a secure way. However, the normal
development workflow changes quite a bit, as OpenSocial acts as a caching
proxy. So in order to get changes in your app down to the user/tester/you, you
need to set an additional variable that will re-retrieve the specification for
your app. In order to get to that, you need to find the URL to the iframe that
contains your app, which is only available in a javascript block, add the
cache busting variable, drop the URL in your browser, and hard refresh. That
only worked sometimes. And when it did work, it was pretty much guaranteed
that the change you made didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the workflow was painful, even on the best days. Add to that,
some weird firewall issues, and you had a situation that would make St Francis
of Assisi murder kittens. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.passionpitmusic.com/">Passion
Pit</a> came in. Their music is just
so…damn…happy. In most cases Passion Pit saved me from putting my fist through
my monitor.</p>

<p>RightScale, Rackspace Cloud configuration</p>

<p>In attempt to save ourselves some money, and automate a lot of the SysAdmin
work I&#8217;d been doing by hand over the past couple years, I undertook a
partnership with RightScale. Since in every case, the servers I was deploying
didn&#8217;t have php, or any other language I knew by default, I had to resort to
bash, which I didn&#8217;t know. This project took me very out of my comfort zone,
had a Mt Everest of a learning curve, and was so essential to our growth that
it couldn&#8217;t fail. There were also tons of moving parts that were out of my
control. RightScale&#8217;s integration with the Rackspace cloud is in Beta, which
meant that in addition to struggling through a language I didn&#8217;t know, I had
to differentiate my own errors from things that were problems with the sever
images. Tons &#8216;o fun.</p>

<p>In stepped <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebronx">The Bronx (III)</a>, probably one of
the most solid rock bands I&#8217;ve heard in a long time. Their tracks had a real
sense of purpose, and the lyrics echoed a lot of my desperation. In
particular, the line in Pleasure Seekers where desperation is cited as
inspiration totally got me through.</p>

			Distributed Updates</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Part of managing any large site involves writing scripts that will go through
oyur data, make changes, merge things, remove things, do type transformations,
etc. Most of the time, in PHP, iterating through rows or objects will do just
fine. However, when there are lots of rows or objects, you could be faced with
a script that takes hours or days to run. Depending on how often active the
is, you may need to restrict access to ensure that the data before and after
the transformation remains consistent. In other words, if someone tries to
make a change to the data before the transformation, and the new feature only
looks at data after the transformation, that user has just lost their changes.
That is Very Bad.</p>

<p>As sites get larger and problems like this loom, taking the site offline
becomes less and less of an option. This is what the business team calls a
luxury problem, and what the ops team refers to simply as a problem. One
option is to write a more efficient script. You can get pretty far by simply
ensuring you&#8217;re reading from the fastest data source available, make good use
of cache, etc. ensure that the tables being read for the transformation are
properly indexed. All of these are great places to start. Additionally, making
sure that data is grabbed in chunks can give the database time to breathe.
There&#8217;s nothing worse than getting stuck in MySQL&#8217;s &#8220;sending data&#8221; phase
simply because it needs to read several thousand rows from disk. MySQL
configuration can also be your friend here. If using InnoDB, increasing the
insert buffer is a great way to speed up writes.*</p>

<p>However, as much as you can do to speed up a single transaction, the fact
remains that you have to execute each transformation serially, one after
another. Your bottleneck is the transformation itself. It will take (# of
transformations * # of objects to transform) to complete the job. No matter
how well tuned the database is, it will only be performing one operation at a
time, which means that the other (max connections - 1) connections are doing
precisely crap. So the next logical step is to change your update script to
distribute the update operations so a few can be run in parrallel.</p>

<p>Rewriting the update script does require thinking about your update
differently, and will not work in every case. For example, if one is simply
moving a large amount of data from one table to another, and there is no
transformation, or the transformation can be accomplished via a builtin MySQL
function, use that. However, just be prepared to deal with locking issues, and
the source data potentially not being available while the transformation is
taking place. However, if your transformation is complicated, and requires
per-case logic, this is definitely a good route to take. The biggest
difference is how the code for the update is organized. The update script
needs to be separated out into code that will apply the transformation for
exactly one entity, and code that will manage which entities get transformed
and when. Ideally, the code for the transformation is idempotent, so failures
can be handled by simply resubmitting the entity / object to be transformed
again.</p>

<p>Accomplishing parallel processing in PHP can be kind of tricky. Php&#8217;s
pcntl_exec function has always felt a bit finicky to me. Of course exec on its
own it blocking, so that&#8217;s out. Additionally, neither of these solutions offer
any sort of baked-in communication between the process that submitted the job,
and the process carrying out the job. That leaves us with a queuing system.
Popular systems include: RabbitMQ and Gearman. Personally, I&#8217;ve made great use
of <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2009/07/25/gearman/">Gearman</a>. It&#8217;s easy to
install, as is the PHP module.</p>

<p>To sum up, performing large data updates via a distributed system is the way
to go if you have complex requirements per transformation, and the option to
perform these processes in parallel.</p>

<p>*If using MySQL&#8217;s MyISAM engine, this isn&#8217;t necessarily true, as writes will block, and the database could become the bottleneck. However, since MySQL is continuing to push InnnDB, this is getting increasingly unlikely. So if your tables are all InnoDB, you&#8217;re probably in good shape.</p>
