    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After much neglect, and a few insane weeks, I've finally gotten the time to update a few things in my daily toolkit. First, RSS; I've decided to go all in with <a href="http://www.feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a>. I've found it to be a great cross-platform candidate that's had to deal with a <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/06/21/summary-of-the-last-100-days/">lot of scaling challenges</a> in a very, very short period of time. I give them a lot of credit for building a massive platform and being able to continue to add features to what looks like a web app with great potential. At the moment, my only real gripe would be a progress indicator in the browser of the iOS app.</p>

<p>Secondly, I've made a few small updates to this very site. Since Twitter has deprecated v1 of their API, which the <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> supplied twitter widget depends on, has crapped out. Since I've been all about minimalism lately, it seemed appropriate to simply pull the plug on it. That decision led me down the rabbit hole of how to update Octopress themes. (Hint: if you are using a theme, and you edit sass and html files in source, <a href="http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l142/gstatejester/02-youre-doing-it-wrong.jpg?t=1285658433" target="_blank">you're doing it wrong</a>.) That revelation led me to forking the venerable <a href="https://github.com/tommy351/Octopress-Theme-Slash">Slash</a> Octopress theme. <a href="https://github.com/chrishenry/Octopress-Theme-Slash">My own fork</a> loses the Twitter feed, narrows the layout a bit, and adds an Add to Feedly link.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, I decided to refresh my blogging platform. My Wordpress was old and busted, and working on it didn't quite fit with the way I wanted to work. I tried tumblr for a few weeks, but it felt pretty constraining. Overall, I was looking for a platform that gave me control, and the ability to crack open the source and do what I wanted.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Overall, here were the features I was looking for</p>

<ul>
<li>Display code beautifully, right off the bat.</li>
<li>Add plugins. Maybe even write them myself.</li>
<li>Be able to have all my content organized how I want.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> was a perfect fit. Working with git, the command line, and markdown are all things that are very familiar to me. There's a great community around it, and enough open development around it to support most of the things I want to do. And if the community hasn't built it yet, then I can certainly give it a try myself.</p>

<p>The docs on the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress</a> site are really good. Aside from the typical challenges of upgrading Ruby on Mac. <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> was extremely helpful with the upgrade to Ruby 1.9.3.  Also, the provisioning of a Heroku dyno, and the deploy was as close to painless as it gets.</p>

<p>The migration, however, was not quite as simple. I had plenty of trouble getting my content into tumblr, and I also had a bit of trouble getting it out. Tom Preston-Warner's <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">github wiki</a> was very helpful. However, be aware that the default ruby gems are a little out of date, and the information <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/773">this resolved issue</a> helped get around the trouble.</p>

<p>Once the posts were actually imported, there still needed to be a bit of massaging done to get them into shape. The yaml header was using tags instead of categories. In the source/_posts folder, a quick sed command got me what I wanted.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Sed snippet  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">$ </span>sed -i <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;s/&lt;sup&gt;tags/categories/&#39;</span>&lt;/sup&gt; *
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I do miss my old Wordpress blog, but it was definitely time for a change, as that had been my blog for years. Setting up Octopress has been a great experiment in looking at another language (ruby, and some python), getting more familiar with git, and getting even more acquainted with SublimeText.</p>
