    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your time is extremely valuable, and execution of your product is everything.
When it comes to building out key pieces of infrastructure, the choice of
whether to build it, buy it, or use open source is very personal,
and depends on what the business really needs.</p>

<p>You do things yourself when you need fine grained control of a resource, or
require a deep understanding of a mission critical function. Can anyone do it
better than you can? Even if they can, do you have enough control in the
direction to get what you need? Does the time it takes to learn and execute in a
given domain warrant the value it provides? Or could that time be spent on
something else that would move the needle?</p>

<p>Dead giveaways are things the user sees. Design and product development can’t be
outsourced, nor can the actual execution of your product. Those stay in house,
no matter what. Your ability to find your voice and interact with your customers
is the thing that makes your product unique. If you cannot execute on your own
product, it's a strong indication you're not doing the right thing.</p>

<p>However, depending on your needs, there gets to be a long list of things that
aren’t your product, but are still critical to running your business. Campaign
and transactional email are great examples. Executing on mass email is extremely
difficult because of defenses put in place by major ISPs. You need an IP with a
good reputation, reverse DNS, a host that will allow massive amount of email to
leave it’s datacenter, and the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>There are also implicit supporting requirements of running a service that you
need to have but shouldn't ever try to build. Project tracking, monitoring,
graphing, and alerting are all examples of components that have executed
extremely well by others, and can simply be turned on or deployed with minimal
effort on the part of your team.</p>

<p>In the end, what’s critical is spending your energy on the things that actually
create impact. Knowing the intersection of tradeoffs and priorities is what will
keep your team on the path that gets the job done.</p>

-Herman Wouk, The Caine Mutiny</p></blockquote>

<p>The worst arguments I've ever had were with people who weren't willing to bend
on policy in situations where the policy made no sense. Context is everything,
and most policy is made for a situation that has likely come and gone.</p>

<p>People with judgment will recognize this, especially in the context of running
startups. Hopefully, they were the same person that made the original policy,
and can see that things have changed. Smart companies have fewer policies,
implicitly trusting their teams to make the right decision.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love/56">Hubspot's Presentation Culture Code: Creating A Lovable Company</a></p>

<p>The takeaway here is that you can judge organizations and people based on how beholden they are to policy. Smart ones let you make smart decisions.</p>
