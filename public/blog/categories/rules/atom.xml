    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I took a trip to London and Paris. It was my first trip to
Europe. Having never been to Europe, or on a real vacation for the last couple
years, I was really looking to maximize my time there. So I had a couple rules
while for I was there;</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a long list of things to do, but no plan.</li>
<li>Walk or take public transportation everywhere.</li>
<li>Get to know the neighborhoods I'm staying in.</li>
<li>If something looks interesting, do it.</li>
<li>Don't be an #uglyamerican.</li>
</ol>


<p>As it turns out, those were some really great rules. The last thing I wanted
in a vacation was a schedule. Plus, if we got involved in something, and took
more time than we thought, it wouldn't matter. And following rule #2 the
entire and rule #4 the entire trip, there were plenty of things that we found
along the way that took up more time than we thought. The <a href="http://www.camdenlock.net/stables/index.html">Camden
Stalls</a>, for example, were full
of treasures and side alleys to explore.</p>

<p>Rule #2 turned out to be pretty great for a bunch of reasons. The London tube
is super efficient, clean, and has wifi. The only drawback of the Underground
is that it closes early, as does most of London. Walking a city is really the
only way to really get to know a city. Also, getting lost is the best way to
find the really cool stuff.</p>
