	<h2 class="title">New Years Actionable (Non-whiner) Resolutions</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Normally, I&#8217;ve considered New Year&#8217;s Resolutions to be for whiners, people who
never actually accomplish anything, people who are normally on the
whhhaaaambulance. Most resolutions fall somewhere in the &#8220;stop being fat&#8221; to
&#8220;be fluent in mesopotamian glyphs&#8221; range. They&#8217;re vague, completely un-
actionable, and just describe a slightly unattainable goal / end result /
dumbass want. This year, however, I&#8217;ve discovered a few serious problems in my
life I need to fix. So, in the spirit of actually doing shit, I&#8217;ve provided a
list of non-whiner resolutions + ways to actually make them happen.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Go to bed early(ish)</strong>. This is a tough one for me. I&#8217;m naturally a night
owl, but I might be able to fool myself to getting to bed early by showering
early(ish). I love me a good shower. I&#8217;ve even been known to drink a beer in
the shower. I also really like being in really warm, comfortable, if slightly
embarrassing, PJs. All these things put me in a good mood and generally make
me want to relax, which is not all that far from being asleep. Action Steps:
Just get in the fucking shower, don&#8217;t look at the mail / email / dirty dishes
/ messy apartment / email / Twitter, just get in the shower (bring a beer).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>See some doctors</strong>. I&#8217;ve avoided doctors for awhile, mostly because my
lifestyle is a cross between Denis Nedry from Jurassic Park and a barfly. I
consider this pretty simple. Action Steps: Make appointments with the
following: dentist, general physician, eye doctor, nutritionist. Do it. Do
what they say, even if it sucks. Follow up as often as the quacks say so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Go to the gym regularly</strong>. OK, this one is, without a doubt, the most
cliche, whine-tastic resolution evar. I know, because I have been to the gym
in January. I&#8217;ve also been to the gym in April, when all the kids who were at
the gym in January are nowhere to be found. Also, since the gym is a #creepy
and #gross place to shower, resolution #1 should be even more important.
Action Steps: Put that ish on the Google calendar with the following
reminders; 2 hours, 1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes
before. Keep gym clothes in the office. Don&#8217;t care how bad they smell.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blog more</strong>. Writing has been a great way to get me to collect my
thoughts, find some hindsight, and maybe, just maybe, help some other folks
who have the same demented thoughts / stupid problems. As a technical guy,
&#8220;the inspiration&#8221; doesn&#8217;t hit me so often, and when it does, I&#8217;m often busy,
y&#8217;know, actually doing shit. However, as I&#8217;ve noted to myself more than once,
keeping track of my day and journaling how I spend my time is something
incredibly important for introspection. Action Steps: Write that thought down.
Write down what you did 30 seconds ago, especially if it was different from
regularly scheduled programming. Keep a sticky on your monitor to write shite
down. Ask the dude next to you (<a href="http://twitter.com/bossjones">@bossjones</a>) to
remind you to you write shit down. Lastly, a glass (or 7) of white wine, the
notebook in which all your shit is written, and wordpress should convene
regularly. Google Calendar #ftw, again. Lastly, check Google Analytics on
posts. The un-monitored blog post is not worth writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read more</strong>. Once upon a time (yesterday) I didn&#8217;t know nearly as much as
I do now. Most of that knowledge came from reading shit-tons of blogs, books,
bathroom graffiti, articles, and whitepapers related to web development. I
read everything with a goal: How can I use, or leverage this to help me / my
business work a little better? The Action Steps here are a bit tougher, and
slightly conflict with non-whiner resolution #6: Keep Google Reader open.
Curate my list of feeds with relevant sources. Prune feeds that stopped
providing useful information. Lastly, and perhaps most important, find tidbits
of information that make a difference in my life and / or business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t be distracted by bold numbers in parentheses</strong>. Simple (kinda).
Action Steps: close Gmail, close Twitter. Try, and #fail, to delete my
Facebook account.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stop playing so much fucking air guitar by myself, alone in my apt, and
start playing some real guitar, and actually learn the songs I normally rock
out to</strong>. Action Steps: restring the Epiphone, buy a new amp, find tabs for
shit I want to learn. If I&#8217;m feeling really frisky, get back into a band.</p></li>
</ol>
