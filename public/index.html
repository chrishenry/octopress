			Volunteering at Hour of Code</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday, as part of the Hour of Code, I went to <a href="http://ithsnyc.org/2013/home">Information Technology High
School</a> in Long Island City. I spent the morning
talking to students about what it&#8217;s like to work in Web Operations.</p>

<p>It was amazing seeing students taking an interest in technology and coding. Many
of them had already completed the <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us">Hour of Code</a>
projects. Others were still tinkering, seeing what they could add and change. I
spent some time critiquing and reviewing work they had done in Mrs. Ramirez&#8217;s
Web Design class. The students had all created functional portfolio sites,
complete with content, small bits of javascript, and even Flash games.</p>

<p>The students were interested in my day to day, and the path I took to get
where I am in my career. The students were amazed to hear that I didn&#8217;t work in
a dark closet by myself, but in a brightly lit office constantly interacting
with colleagues. They were also amazed to hear that the skills they needed to be
truly successful in tech weren&#8217;t just coding and hardware, but communication,
teamwork, and judgment. How a college education fit in to a career in Web
Operations came up a few times. It was particularly interesting because I&#8217;m not
aware of any four year university that offers a program in the field.</p>

<p>Students were particularly interested to hear about about some of the
work I&#8217;ve done around security and incident response. Tales of defending
against <a href="http://chr.ishenry.com/2013/07/29/what-it-feels-like-to-be-ddosed/">DDoS</a>
and spam attacks were a great way to let them know that career paths in tech
aren&#8217;t just limited to coding or back office IT. They were spellbound to hear
that mitigating DDoS attacks were actually something that could be part
of an actual career path, and not just something they see in TV and movies. I
truly hope that some students are inspired to pursue a career in Systems
Administration and Web Operations.</p>

<p>One thing that was made clear to me as I was asked to describe my path to Web
Operations was there is no clear path, and that sad fact has resulted in a
shortage of people in the field. I would encourage other folks in Web Operations
to spend some time talking to young students about the work that we do in the
hopes that in a few years the industry will grow and mature. After all, for
every class that learns to code, there need to be a few students who know
how to run the infrastructure for that code.</p>

			AWS Tags as a Lightweight Datastore</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the most common tasks in administering clusters of machines is running
regular tasks on individual machines in a cluster. For example, Cassandra
benefits greatly from running repairs on individual nodes to ensure data
consistency. Operating manually, an ops team would maintain a document of when
each machine has been, and look at that to determine which machine should be
repaired next.</p>

<p>However, in a world where there could be hundreds of machines, this quickly
becomes unscalable. Even with only a handful of machines, a team could spend a
ton of energy and time simply remembering where the source of truth lives and
how to decide which machine should be repaired next.</p>

			Burnout</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was 4:43 PM. As I headed out the door, someone asked, &#8220;Leaving early?&#8221; No
malice, no judgment, just a bit of surprise. The office was still full,
keyboards clicking and the drone of technical conversation dully throbbing. &#8220;I&#8217;m
entitled to it, I just worked an incident for 3 days straight,&#8221; I shot back.</p>

<p>Was I entitled to bail early? Probably, but that wasn&#8217;t the right way to say it.
I <strong>needed</strong> to leave. Despite handling the incident deftly, I still felt
fucking awful, and in a dark, looming, nonspecific way. I needed to run from the
firehose of problems, lack of solutions, apathy and anxiety. The incident in
question was a days-long spam attack. It wasn&#8217;t my first rodeo with hackers, but
this mitigation required bringing several groups together, which is always a
challenge at a large organization. To add to that, there was a pronounced lack
of resources from my own team. This attack came at a time when we were gearing
up to launch a new product, and the team was completely focused on it. Even I
had been intensely involved with ensuring the stability of a new, shaky
platform. Being pulled away just added to my frustration.</p>

<p>I had already spoken with my manager that afternoon, told him I was tired. He
kindly ordered me to go home, and take a vacation. I took the next two days off,
calling in sick. This was the second time in a month I&#8217;d unexpectedly needed
time off. At home, I crashed, played video games, watched a bunch of shitty
movies my girlfriend normally wouldn&#8217;t palate, and generally just tried to avoid
the real world. Physically, I wasn&#8217;t all that tired, considering I had only
slept 9 hours or so over the past 3 days. But my mind and nerves were totally
shot, and worse, I felt like I didn&#8217;t care, which I hated myself for.</p>

<p>In short, I burned out. Hard.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed, communication among teams (distributed or local) is a
thing that people care a lot about. For my team, we specifically care about
density of quality communication across mediums. We&#8217;re an ops team, and
being able to broadcast status and information is critically important. As we
work, we don&#8217;t want to have to re-communicate across mediums, but we still want
to make sure the right people hear us and provide feedback.</p>

<p>As our team was searching for ways to accomplish this, we started using the
ubiquitous and humble webhook to push information between systems. At first,
we simply started pushing Pull Request comments into our Slack channel. This
immediately increased our velocity, as we found ourselves seamlessly moving
discussions from traditionally asynchronous mediums (Github Pull Requests) to
more real time mediums (Slack, In Person).</p>

		<p>AWS provides auto scaling to allow applications to scale up and
down to meet demand. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">Autoscaling</a> is an
excellent tactic for ensuring that an application can add and remove capacity
based on demand. Autoscale policies can be infinitely tuned to use anything that
can be recorded by CloudWatch. However, autoscale groups are also incredibly
useful for ensuring that a set number of instances is always available. This can
be accomplished by omitting scaling policies.</p>

			FizzBuzz in Go and Rust</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My team and I attended DockerCon earlier this week. We went with the intention
of taking time at the hackathon to spend some time digging into what it would be
like to operate services running on Docker &amp; CoreOS. Part of the challenge
of CoreOS is that there isn&#8217;t a package manager, which makes installing any
modern programming language difficult. The only way to execute code is to drop a
binary on the machine or to run code in a Docker container.</p>

<p>Therefore, it made a lot of sense to take some time to experiment with both Go
and Rust. It was also a ton of fun to play with some new ideas. To get a grasp
of the basics, I looked to the tried and true <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest">FizzBuzz</a>.
FizzBuzz is a great exercise because it forces you to loop, use control logic
(if/else or case), and understand some basic math operators.</p>

		<p>While having drinks with a colleague, the topic of improving execution within an
organization came up. There had been some problems in the past few years, but
this was an organization trying to operate in an unfamiliar way, and it was
suggested that problems could&#8217;ve been avoided by having a conscientious
operator. At one point in the conversation, the following was said;</p>

<blockquote><p>The people who push the buttons that cause problems should be fired. Heads
should roll.</p></blockquote>

			Advanced Serverspec</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Testing the outcome of infrastructure provisioning is an operator&#8217;s bread and
butter. Good cookbook tests create predictable automation, and can be added to
once problems are inevitably discovered. Serverspec is a huge part of ensuring
that infrastructure being provisioned via chef is actually in the desired
state.</p>

<p>Combining ruby&#8217;s builtin libraries to parse and manipulate configuration files
with serverspec is a quick and simple win. We&#8217;re no longer bound by having to
use overly complex, brittle regexes to ensure files are created correctly.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a few ways to pull in rubygems when writing serverspec;</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply use ruby <code>include</code></li>
<li>Add a Gemfile to your serverspec folder</li>
<li>Use Gem::DependencyInstaller in the spec_helper.rb</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s an example of installing the <code>inifile</code> gem in your <code>spec_helper.rb</code>.</p>

<p>Parsing config files with similar libs that would be consuming them in
production provides a lightweight, implied method of testing that those files
are valid. It&#8217;s also a straightforward, programmatic approach to getting values
out of configuration files. And not just scalar values, but lists and arrays.</p>

			Coding Music, Spring 2015</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Normally, I&#8217;m a big fan of music without lyrics or much adornment for coding,
but for the past few months, there have been a few albums in my rotation that
are pretty heavy on the lyrics and complications. This edition has four guitar
heavy albums, and three with way more singing than usual.</p>

<h3><em>Antemasque</em>, Antemasque</h3>

<p>Antemasque is a newish project from Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, from Mars Volta and At
the Drive-In fame. While Mars Volta have long been a favorite for coding, thanks
to the free form jazz and overall chaotic energy, Antemasque is significantly
more straight ahead progressive rock. Busy guitars, with only a light coat of
fuzz, push forward and provide a sonic landscape you can lose yourself in.
Cedric Bixler-Zavala&#8217;s vocals are elegantly mixed in, riding right alongside the
guitars. Most of album has a quick, steady drive, with only a quick slowdown for
&#8220;Drown All Your Witches&#8221; and &#8220;Providence&#8221;.</p>

<h3><em>Monuments</em>, Ume</h3>

<p>I found this album through <a href="http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/795103-20-best-albums-2014">Crave Online&#8217;s Best Albums of 2014</a>.
I&#8217;m a huge sucker for a band with a big sound and a strong female front, having
spent a lot of time listening to the Joy Formidable after seeing them at SXSW
years ago. Ume (pronounced ooh-may) is usually a bit more of what I&#8217;m looking
for, tempowise, in coding music. Most songs are a laid back andante, moved along
by thrumming bass. What I like most is Lauren Larson&#8217;s silky, gently echoing
voice over shiny, just shy of screeching guitar licks.</p>

<h3><em>Gangs</em>, And So I Watch You from Afar</h3>

<p>As creepy as this band&#8217;s name is, they are anything but. Their more recent
album, <em>All Hail Bright Futures</em>, was contagiously happy and comforting, but
that&#8217;s for another post. <em>Gangs</em>, on the other hand, is certainly
non-threatening, but has a big enough punch to kick your ass even through Apple
earbuds. Both albums were instrumental, and as such have been a big part of my
Spotify rotation. The standout track for me is &#8220;Search:Party:Animal&#8221;, with a
desperate, machine guitar riff driving away, punctuated by mountainous bass guitar hits.
Interwoven throughout are quiet, but perturbed bass interludes that eventually
culminate in the band coming together for builds that drop into high jitter. The
whole thing ends in a midrange modulation turned into a samba-esque power chord
riff with an abrupt but tasty ending. The rest of the album presents the same
mountainous walls of guitar distortion.</p>

<h3><em>Gemini, Her Majesty</em>, RX Bandits</h3>

<p>The RX Bandits were a favorite of mine a few years ago, and <em>Gemini, Her
Majesty</em> is their first record in five years. Again, big thanks to <a href="http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/795103-20-best-albums-2014">Crave
Online</a>
for uncovering this one. What I like here is the relaxed, smooth, yet exuberant
crooning over bright SoCal guitar riffs. There&#8217;s lots of forward movement, as
most of the album has a quick pace, driving at times, but powerful riffs where
the whole band hits together.</p>

			When to Do It Yourself</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Your time is extremely valuable, and execution of your product is everything.
When it comes to building out key pieces of infrastructure, the choice of
whether to build it, buy it, or use open source is very personal,
and depends on what the business really needs.</p>

<p>You do things yourself when you need fine grained control of a resource, or
require a deep understanding of a mission critical function. Can anyone do it
better than you can? Even if they can, do you have enough control in the
direction to get what you need? Does the time it takes to learn and execute in a
given domain warrant the value it provides? Or could that time be spent on
something else that would move the needle?</p>

<p>Dead giveaways are things the user sees. Design and product development can’t be
outsourced, nor can the actual execution of your product. Those stay in house,
no matter what. Your ability to find your voice and interact with your customers
is the thing that makes your product unique. If you cannot execute on your own
product, it&#8217;s a strong indication you&#8217;re not doing the right thing.</p>

<p>However, depending on your needs, there gets to be a long list of things that
aren’t your product, but are still critical to running your business. Campaign
and transactional email are great examples. Executing on mass email is extremely
difficult because of defenses put in place by major ISPs. You need an IP with a
good reputation, reverse DNS, a host that will allow massive amount of email to
leave it’s datacenter, and the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>There are also implicit supporting requirements of running a service that you
need to have but shouldn&#8217;t ever try to build. Project tracking, monitoring,
graphing, and alerting are all examples of components that have executed
extremely well by others, and can simply be turned on or deployed with minimal
effort on the part of your team.</p>

<p>In the end, what’s critical is spending your energy on the things that actually
create impact. Knowing the intersection of tradeoffs and priorities is what will
keep your team on the path that gets the job done.</p>
