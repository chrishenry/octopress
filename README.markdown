## Chris Henry's Octopress

Octopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging at its finest.

## Octopress Documentation

Check out [Octopress.org](http://octopress.org/docs) for guides and documentation.

## Docker deploy

To make deploys less dependent on installing a ton of software, I've created a
Docker container that has ruby, octopress, and aws gems installed.

```bash
fugu run "rake s3"
```
